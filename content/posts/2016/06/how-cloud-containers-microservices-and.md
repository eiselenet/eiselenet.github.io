No, this isn't a customer success story. And this isn't the typical post about some awesome stuff that you can do with technology. This time it is actually about knowledge in a different kind. Lightbend would love to know how you use the Cloud, Containers and Microservices in your daily work. How Enterprises are adopting these technologies and last but not least, how influential are the decisions that are made in development to the final system architecture choices being made.

 Lightbend is donating to Charity for each completed survey! It's going to be either #yeswecode, SeniorNet or Mouse and you can select the cause at the end of the survey. &nbsp;Make you voice heard and your answers count! We are aiming to break 3000 respondents, which unlocks a total donation of $1500!
