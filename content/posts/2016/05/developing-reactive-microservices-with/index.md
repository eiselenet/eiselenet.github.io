I am very happy to announce, that I finished another O'Reilly Mini-Book a couple of weeks ago. After the success of the very first edition which <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2015/10/my-book-modern-java-ee-design-patterns.html" target="_blank">introduced you to the overall problem space of microservices</a> and the amazing book by Jonas Bonér about the <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2016/03/free-ebook-about-reactive-microservices.html" target="_blank">architecture of reactive microservice systems</a>, it was about time to share a little more about how to implement them in Java. I am very proud to had Jonas write the foreword for this one and that I was able to write another 50+ pages in such a short time. The book uses Lagom as a framework to walk you through the service API, persistence API and how to work with Lagom-Services. Can't wait to hear your feedback and get you to try out Lagom. Here is the complete abstract and you'll find some further readings and links at the very bottom of the post. Did I mention, it is <a href="https://info.lightbend.com/COLL-20XX-Developing-Reactive-Microservices_Landing-Page.html?lst=BL" target="_blank">free to download</a>? It is!

 Abstract:
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
 <a href="https://info.lightbend.com/COLL-20XX-Developing-Reactive-Microservices_Landing-Page.html?lst=BL" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="Reactive_Microservices_Thumbnail.jpg"></a>
</div> With microservices taking the software industry by storm, traditional enterprises running large, monolithic Java EE applications have been forced to rethink what they’ve been doing for nearly two decades. But how can microservices built upon reactive principles make a difference?
<br>
<br>
 In this O’Reilly report, author Markus Eisele walks Java developers through the creation of a complete reactive microservices-based system. You’ll learn that while microservices are not new, the way in which these independent services can be distributed and connected back together certainly is. The result? A system that’s easier to deploy, manage, and scale than a typical Java EE-based infrastructure.
<br>
<br>
 With this report, you will:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>Get an overview of the Reactive Programming model and basic requirements for developing reactive microservices</li>
 <li>Learn how to create base services, expose endpoints, and then connect them with a simple, web-based user interface</li>
 <li>Understand how to deal with persistence, state, and clients</li>
 <li>Use integration technologies to start a successful migration away from legacy systems</li>
 <li>The detailed example in this report is based on Lagom, a new framework that helps you follow the requirements for building distributed, reactive systems. Available on GitHub as an Apache-licensed open source project, this example is freely available for download.</li>
</ul>
