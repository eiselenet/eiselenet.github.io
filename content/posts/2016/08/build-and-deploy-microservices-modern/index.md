There's been a lot of buzz from me lately around microservices and containers. And all the efforts were directed towards today's <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/company/news/lightbend-and-mesosphere-drive-container-20-era-with-reactive-platform-on-dcos" target="_blank">public announcement by Lightbend and Mesosphere</a>. If you are interested in learning more about how traditional architectures are beginning to evolve very quickly to embrace microservices architecture and various cloud and hybrid-cloud deployment models, I would love to invite you to listen to the recording of my recent webinar with Aaron Williams from Mesosphere. Find the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Lightbend/modernizing-applications-with-microservices-and-dcos-lightbendmesosphere-cowebinar" target="_blank">slides on slideshare</a>, the recording is embedded below.

 The traditional model that enterprises run their businesses on has typically been delivered as monolithic applications running in a virtualized, on-premise infrastructure. We’ve seen how public and private cloud technologies have changed everything, but if the applications are not designed, or re-designed, appropriately, then it is impossible to take advantage of the advances in both distributed application services and hybrid infrastructure. Consequently, we will show how enterprise architects are looking to microservices architecture and technologies like Mesosphere DC/OS as a means to modernize their legacy applications.
<br>
<br>
 This webinar introduces Lagom, a new framework specifically designed to help developers modernize legacy Java EE applications into systems of microservices and then discuss exactly what is required to run these distributed systems at enterprise scale with DC/OS.
