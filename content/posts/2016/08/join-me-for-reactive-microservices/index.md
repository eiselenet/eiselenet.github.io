What are the benefits of the Reactive Manifesto and the Microservices approach, especially for those who want to fundamentally modernize their business? I will discuss this at the free event „<a href="https://www.eventbrite.de/e/reactive-microservices-roadshow-registrierung-26872426150" target="_blank">Reactive Microservices Roadshow</a>“, on 28th September in Berlin. The event is hosted by <a href="" target="_blank">codecentric AG</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Lightbend</a>. There will be three talks which walk you through the most important parts.

<br><b>Reaktive Mircroservices with Akka (Heiko Seeberger)</b>
<br>
 The Reactive Manifesto defines essential qualities which modern systems need to have in order to cope with today's requirements: Responsiveness, which is the cornerstone of usability and utility, requires resilience and elasticity; all of these are based upon asynchronous messaging. In this talk we look at the meaning of "Reactive" for a microservice architecture, for individual services and for their collaboration.

<br><b>AutoScout24 goes Microservices (Christian Deger)</b>
<br>
 Fed up with stop and go in your data center? Why not shift into overdrive and pull into the fast lane? Learn how AutoScout24, the largest online car marketplace Europe-wide, are building their Autobahn in the cloud.
<br>
 Reinventing themselves by making a radical transition from monoliths to microservices, from .NET on Windows to Scala on Linux, from data center to AWS and from built by devs and run by ops to a DevOps mindset.

<br><b>One microservice is no microservice—they come in systems! (Markus Eisele)</b>
<br>
 Building a complete system out of individual Microservices is not as simple as we're being told. While Microservices-based Architecture continues to draw more and more attention we're also starting to learn about the trade-offs and drawbacks. Individual Microservices are fairly easy to understand and implement, but they only make sense as systems, and it is in-between the services that the most challenging (and interesting) problems arise—here we are entering the world of distributed systems.
