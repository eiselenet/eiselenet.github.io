</div> The cake is backed. We're proud to announce that the new Apache licensed microservice framework <a href="https://github.com/lagom/lagom" target="_blank">Lagom is available on GitHub</a>! While other frameworks focus on packaging and instance startup, Lagom redefines the way that Java developers build microservice based applications. Services are asynchronous. Intra-service communication is managed for you. Streaming is out of the box. Your microservices are resilient by nature. And you can program in the language you love the most: Java.
<br>
<br><b>What is Lagom? And what does Lagom mean?</b>
<br>
<div class="p1">
 Lagom (pronounced [ˈlɑ̀ːɡɔm]) is a Swedish word meaning just right, sufficient. And as such it will help you build microservice based applications in an easier way. Instead of having to find your own answers to how to effectively develop, debug and run tens of different services on your machine you can finally focus on what really is important: The implemented business logic. Lagom takes care for all of the rest for you and eventually helps you to stage and run your application in production. The design is based on <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.0.x/LagomDesignPhilosophy.html" target="_blank">three main principles</a>:
</div>
<div class="p1">
</div>
<ol>
 <li>Is asynchronous by default.</li>
 <li>Favours distributed persistent patterns, in contrast to the traditional centralised database.</li>
 <li>Places a high emphasis on developer productivity.</li>
</ol>
<br><b>How do I get started?</b>
<br>
 Read through the <a href="http://www.lagomframework.com/documentation/1.0.x/Installation.html#Quick-setup" target="_blank">quick setup documentation</a> and watch the 11 minute getting started video by
<br>
 Mirco Dotta who shows you that development is already familiar: Use your favorite IDE and favorite dependency injection tools. You leverage the old to build something new.
