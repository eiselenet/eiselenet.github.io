</div> Working with and talking about microservices has been my focus for a while already. And since I started working at Lightbend I already had the pleasure to work with some amazing people. One of them is Jonas&nbsp;Bonér&nbsp;and it has been a real pleasure helping with the&nbsp;creation of this little mini book about reactive microservices. Many of the concepts described in this book are the foundation for our newly open source microservices framework <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2016/03/let-lagom-help-with-your-microservices-troubles.html" target="_blank">Lagom</a>. It makes getting started into the world of JVM based microservices and reactive systems and introduces all the important aspects that you should have a brief understanding about.
<br>
<br>
 And the best part is, that it is available for free at <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/reactive-microservices-architecture" target="_blank">lightbend.com</a>.

 Written for architects and developers that must quickly gain a fundamental understanding of microservice-based architectures, this free O’Reilly report explores the journey from SOA to microservices, discusses approaches to dismantling your monolith, and reviews the key tenets of a Reactive microservice:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>Isolate all the Things</li>
 <li>Act Autonomously</li>
 <li>Do One Thing, and Do It Well</li>
 <li>Own Your State, Exclusively</li>
 <li>Embrace Asynchronous Message-Passing</li>
 <li>Stay Mobile, but Addressable</li>
 <li>Collaborate as Systems to Solve Problems</li>
</ul>
<br><b>And here is the full abstract:</b>
<br>
 Still chugging along with a monolithic enterprise system that’s difficult to scale and maintain, and even harder to understand? In this concise report, Lightbend CTO Jonas Bonér explains why microservice-based architecture that consists of small, independent services is far more flexible than the traditional all-in-one systems that continue to dominate today’s enterprise landscape.

</div> You’ll explore a microservice architecture, based on Reactive principles, for building an isolated service that’s scalable, resilient to failure, and combines with other services to form a cohesive whole. Specifically, you’ll learn how a Reactive microservice isolates everything (including failure), acts autonomously, does one thing well, owns state exclusively, embraces asynchronous message passing, and maintains mobility.
<br>
<br>
 Bonér also demonstrates how Reactive microservices communicate and collaborate with other services to solve problems. Get a copy of this exclusive report and find out how to bring your enterprise system into the 21st century.
