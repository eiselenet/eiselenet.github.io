</div> Almost two years in Red Hat JBoss Middleware have been a tremendous journey for me. Getting to know so many amazing and gifted people to work with in all kinds of Java EE and integration products and projects really made me realize there is far more talent in open source communities than anywhere else.
<br>
 You’ve known and seen me at different conferences and Java User Groups meetups or read my blogs or are following me on Twitter. While I've been talking about middleware for many years you’ll continue to hear me talk about enterprise grade Java going forward. Focused on education about the latest trends in building enterprise systems in a reactive way with Java.
<br>
<br>
 And as such I'm very happy to announce, that I am joining <a href="" target="_blank">Lightbend</a> as of March 1st as their new Developer Advocate. Follow <a class="g-profile" href="https://plus.google.com/108281124915010080743" target="_blank">+Lightbend</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/lightbend" target="_blank">@Lightbend</a>&nbsp;The importance of Java and the need to build today's enterprise grade systems differently will both be a big part of my future topics. If you have particular wishes and questions already, I'm happy to answer them via my Twitter handle @myfear, comment on my blog or maybe in a complete blogpost.
<br>
<br>
 My journey into containers and microservices architectures will also continue. Going forward I will continue to educate more about how microservices architectures can integrate and complement existing platforms, and will also talk about how to successfully build resilient applications with Java.

 I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.
