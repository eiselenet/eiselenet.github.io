<br><b>About the Author</b>
<br>
 Anders Welén embraced the object-oriented techniques of the Java language early in life, and later evolved to Java Enterprise specifications. As a true believer and evangelist of Open Source, he naturally discovered the JBoss Application Server,
<br>
 which led to years of providing expert consultation, training, and support for the JBoss and Java EE infrastructures.

 Good Luck everybody!
