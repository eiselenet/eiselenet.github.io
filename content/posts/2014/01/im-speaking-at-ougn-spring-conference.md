I'm pretty proud to announce, that I will be speaking at the annual OUGN spring seminar again. After my first time last year I was once again invited to speak by the Norwegian Oracle User Group (OUGN). 
<br>
<br>
 Last year's trip was sheer pleasure and I am very much looking forward to exciting talks and the unique conference experience that cruise ship provides. You can look at my photo sets on Google+ (<a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/100362024804331957185/albums/5867805461910826385" target="_blank">Day 1</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/100362024804331957185/albums/5868194797032005745" target="_blank">Day 2</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/100362024804331957185/albums/5868478105830154945" target="_blank">Day 3</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/100362024804331957185/albums/5868997857076589953" target="_blank">Day 4</a>) or at the <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2013/04/trip-report-ougn-varseminar-2013.html" target="_blank">complete trip report from last year</a> to get a good impression about it.
<br>
 This year, I'll give two presentations in both Java and the Middleware space this year.
<br>

<br>
 Friday April 4, 2014 09:30 - 10:15 Congress 1+2 (Color Magic)
<br><b>WebLogic 101</b> (P166)
<br>
 This is a basic introduction into Java EE 6 and WebLogic 12c for everybody interested in the basics. Giving a brief overview about the needed skills and providing a guide to everything you need to know for getting started. No matter if you're a DBA or developer. 
<br>
<br>
 Thursday April 3, 2014 16:00 - 16:45 Congress 3 (Color Magic)
<br><b>Developer Security Awareness</b> (P163)
<br>
 All the common attacks we've known about for a very long time are still out there, and people still regularly make mistakes regarding them. This is an engaging session about Java EE technology, people, and processes and how they best work together to build a suitable secure system. Derived from practice for use with everyday development, such a system can make the Java EE space a little more secure. 
<br>
<br>
