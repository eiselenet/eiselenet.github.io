Welcome to another episode of my developer interviews. It is my pleasure to introduce Matthias Wessendorf (<a href="https://twitter.com/mwessendorf" target="_blank">@mwessendorf</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">blog</a>), whom I know since a long time already. We've been working in and around Java EE for quite a while and met again in Red Hat finally.
<br>
<br>
 Matthias is working at Red Hat where he is leading the AeroGear project. Previously, he was the PMC Chair of the Apache MyFaces project. Matthias is a regular conference speaker.
<br>
<br>
 We've been talking about all kinds of mobile and his project AeroGear and OpenShift and how to connect Java EE backends to Mobiles of any kind.
<br>
<br>
 Sit back, relax and get a #Coffee+++! Thanks Matthias for taking the time!
