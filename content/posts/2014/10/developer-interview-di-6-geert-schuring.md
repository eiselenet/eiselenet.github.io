I'm happy to welcome you to another episode of my developer interviews. This time happening in the same timezone and a bright awake Markus got the chance to talk to Geert Schuring (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/geertschuring" target="_blank">@geertschuring</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">blog</a>)&nbsp;wo works for Dutch <a href="" target="_blank">Luminis</a>. We talked about his latest project with <a href="" target="_blank">JBoss Fuse</a> and why he loves it a lot. Beside that he gave a very impressive demo which will make my daughters jealous: He controlled a <a href="http://www.tinkerforge.com/en" target="_blank">Tinkerforge</a> LED panel with the help of <a href="" target="_blank">Apache Camel</a> routes (Find the source code for the Camel component in his <a href="https://bitbucket.org/geertschuring/camel-tinkerforge" target="_blank">Bitbucket repository</a>).

 Geert is working as a Java developer since 2006. He always loved the open source concept, and particularly anything that had to do with messaging. For him working on messaging systems and service oriented applications is like playing transport tycoon. He specialized in the Camel/ActiveMQ combination, and particularly in the RedHat Fuse product. At home he likes to install computers and attach a bunch of sensors to them to collect all data. So he is monitoring temperature, humidity, lighting levels, and motion in every room.

 As usual, time to grab a coffee+++ and lean back while listening! Thank you Geert, for taking the time!!
