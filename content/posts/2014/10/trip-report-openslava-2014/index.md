</div> I had the pleasure to attend <a href="" target="_blank">OpenSlava</a> conference in Bratislava last week. It is a one day event which is comparably new and launched last year. This year it grew even bigger and even expanded to another area at the&nbsp;Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technologies (FEI STU) of&nbsp;Bratislava. And as there are no registration fees for the conference, it is a great chance to catch up with a lot of interesting speakers. 
<br>
<br>
 Bratislava is a wonderful city and it is a pity that there was barely enough time to see a little bit of it. The organization of the event was great and everything went smoothly. So, thank you to the whole team!

 I gave a presentation about the 50 Best Features of Java EE 7. The slides are published on speakerdeck. Sorry for having to squeeze everything into 35 minutes. It was a funny rush and I hope the attendees enjoyed it!
