Time for another episode in my developer interview series. Yesterday I had the pleasure to talk to Antoine Sabot-Durand (<a href="https://twitter.com/antoine_sd" target="_blank">@antoine_sd</a>) who is the co-spec-lead of&nbsp;<a href="https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=365" target="_blank">JSR 365</a> (Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java 2.0).&nbsp;Besides working on the CDI specification, he is also responsible for the CDI ecosystem at Red Hat - currently focused on <a href="" target="_blank">DeltaSpike</a>.&nbsp;He's also tech lead on Agorava, a CDI framework helping social media consuming.
<br>
 He has been an IT consultant since 1996, and a Java developer since 2000. Today he is a senior software engineer at Red Hat.
<br>
<br>
 Antoine often fly from his Paris home to meet the community by speaking at Devoxx, Java One, or various JUGs. When not writing specification, coding, tweeting or giving talks, Antoine likes spending time with his wife and 3 children.
<br>
<br>
 Sit back, relax and get a #Coffee+++! Thanks&nbsp;Antoine&nbsp;&nbsp;for taking the time!
