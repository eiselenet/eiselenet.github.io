I can't recall when I started doing those end-of-the-year blog-posts. But it became something that I am really looking forward to do. Getting into the mood of looking back at 12 months, 365.242 days,&nbsp;8765.808 hours and even more seconds. By the average&nbsp;6.8 hours of sleep per night, this gives us ~17 hours per day. A decent percentage of this went into my jobs and hobbies. I've always been passionate about what I've been doing. And this did not change since mid July, when <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2014/07/farewell-msg-systems.html" target="_blank">I decided to join Red Hat</a>. I've meet so many great people and it was fun to explore and learn the Red Hat way.

 My special thanks to the communities around the many amazing JBoss open source projects. You guys rock! It is fun to watch how everything evolves and all the pieces come together. I am truly looking forward to spread the word about all the exciting new things coming to a bunch of my favorite projects.

 But for now, this year is over. And it is time to close a book with may colorful pages. It'll take some time, until I open the first page of 2015. The time in between the years will be all about family and presents and food and smiles and glazing eyes for Christmas.
<br>
 I wish you a&nbsp;prosperous and happy new year and hope to see you soon somewhere on any of the upcoming conferences or Java User Group sessions or on the virtual JBUG.
