</div> Another confirmation came in. <a href="" target="_blank">JDK.IO</a> will be my first stop in 2015. This is the annual conference of the Danish Java User Group (Java Gruppen) and it has been extended this year. Instead of one day it is going to be a full two day conference.
<br>
 The name is an acronym for Java Denmark Input Output - ie a conference for people who reside and work in Denmark with an interest in the Java programming language as such, and all the libraries and platform based on Java.

<br><b>Architecting Large Enterprise Java Projects</b>
<br>
 In the past I've been building component oriented applications with what I had at hand. Mostly driven by the features available in the Java EE standard to be "portable" and easy to use. Looking back this has been a perfect fit for many customers and applications. With an increasing demand for highly integrated applications which use already available services and processes from all over the place (departmental, central or even cloud services) this approach starts to feel more and more outdated. And this feel does not come from a technology perspective but from all the requirements around it. Having this in mind this post is the starting point of a series of how-to's and short tutorials which aim to showcase some more diverse ways of building (Java EE) applications that fit better into today's requirements and landscapes.

<br><b>Wild Flies and a Camel - Java EE Integration Stories</b>
<br>
 Apache Camel is one of the most complete integration frameworks out there. With more than 150 components and a large community it clearly has it's fans. Deploying the lightweight core is easy. Getting into modules and even more components makes this challenging. There are different approaches to ride that Camel. How to get the most out of it with Java EE and WildFly is exactly the topic of this session. It will introduce you to both Java EE 7 and Apache Camel in a very brief way and follows up with the different integration and deployment scenarios along with introducing the tools which help you the most on the way to your integration solution.
