I've had the pleasure to review another book for Packt. This time it is the performance tuning guide for WildFly.&nbsp;Arnold Johansson and Anders Welén took a deeper look into what it takes to develop and run high performance applications on WildFly and collected a bunch of tips and tricks everybody should know.

</div><b>Abstract</b>
<br>
 The hugely successful JBoss Application Server has been updated and is now called WildFly. This cutting edge technology provides a free JEE-certified platform for the software of today and tomorrow. Learning to tune such a platform for optimal performance is vital for a healthy business organization, efficient development, and the smooth running of operations.
<br>
<br>
 This practical book explores how to tune one of the leading open source application servers in its latest reincarnation. In this book, you will learn what performance tuning is and how it can be performed on WildFly and the JVM using solely free and open source tools and utilities.
<br>
<br>
 Learn about various free tools for performance monitoring and tuning, all focused on making them work with WildFly. The tuning journey ventures through the landscape of the major JEE technologies, EJB, Servlets, JPA, JSF, and JMS. Discover best practices for the internal high-performing web container Undertow, WebServices, and REST services so that you end your journey feeling confident in tuning WildFly for optimal performance.

<br><b>The Authors</b>
<br><i>Arnold Johansson</i>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/swesource" target="_blank">@swesource</a>) is a versatile information technologist with a true passion for improving people, businesses, and organizations using "good tech". As an early adapter of the Java language and its growing ecosystem, he is an outspoken proponent of secure Java Enterprise solutions and real Open Source software. After nearly two decades as an IT consultant in many levels and verticals, Arnold now focuses on leading organizations on an architectural stable and efficient path of excellence.
<br><i>Anders Welén</i> embraced the object-oriented techniques of the Java language early in life, and later evolved to Java Enterprise specifications. As a true believer and evangelist of Open Source, he naturally discovered the JBoss Application Server, which led to years of providing expert consultation, training, and support for the JBoss and Java EE infrastructures. As a result, Anders has seen a lot of both good and bad architectures, software solutions, and projects, most of which were a struggle from time to time due to performance problems. Whenever Anders, through presentations, consultation, training, and (in this case) a book, sees that what he's trying to explain is getting through and the audience is picking up on it and adopting it for their own challenges, it gives him a warm feeling inside.
<br>
<br><b>The Content</b>
<br>
 Beside the title, the book is a more general resource for performance tuning around Java EE applications. Most of the chapters do not really rely on WildFly but give general hints about performance tuning essentials, approaches and methodologies used for optimization, like the first chapter. The second chapter covers tools for monitoring and tuning of various Java EE subsystems.Chapter three gives a introductory overview about general JVM tuning principles and applies to any JVM development. Beginning with chapter four it is going to be a bit closer to WildFly. EJBs are covered in chapter 5, JMS in chapter 9 and a general pattern here is to refer to Java EE concepts and apply the WildFly specific examples and extensions.
<br>
<br><b>Writing and Style</b>
<br>
 The language is clear and precise. Additional illustrations, tables, and screenshots make it an easy and understandable read. Occasional basic information about Java EE components and concepts make it easy to follow for &nbsp;beginners, too.
<br>
<br><b>Conclusion and recommendation</b>
<br>
 Beside the title who implies a very narrow focus, this is a book which can be a useful read for almost any Java EE developer out there. The explanations are good and helpful. If you ever had to deal with performance tuning you probably know most of those concepts but having them all in one place also makes this a perfect reference for the experienced developers.
