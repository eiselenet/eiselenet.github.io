Time flies and here is the third edition of the new podcast/screencast cross-over series "Developer Interviews". I had the chance to talk to Christian Posta (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/christianposta" target="_blank">@christianposta</a>) last week. He is a Principal Middleware Specialist/Architect at Red Hat and well known for being an open-source enthusiast and committer on Apache ActiveMQ and Apache Camel. But he is actually interested in all kinds of middleware technologies and has a comparably extensible coverage on <a href="" target="_blank">his&nbsp;own blog</a>.
<br>
<br>
 We've been talking about his job, his history and interests and his latest favorite project which is <a href="" target="_blank">fabric8</a>. So, go and grep a coffee and watch the interview.
