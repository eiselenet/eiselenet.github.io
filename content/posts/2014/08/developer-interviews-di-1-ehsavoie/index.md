I'm proud to introduce a new series on my blog. Today I'm going to publish the first interview I did with one of the amazing community members out there. I want to know more about the many amazing people that work on all kinds of JBoss and Middleware related stuff.

 Emmanuel Hugonnet (<a href="https://twitter.com/ehsavoie" target="_blank">@ehsavoie</a>) is the maintainer of the WildFly Plugin for NetBeans. It's not a big secret, that I like that IDE very much and not having an official plugin available made my heart bleed. With the upcoming NetBeans 8.0.1 which is already available as a <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2014/08/netbeans-nightly-now-includes-wildfly.html" target="_blank">nightly build</a>, you finally get it included right away. But let's look at the interview and hear from Emmanuel first hand what it took to make it happen and how it can be used.
