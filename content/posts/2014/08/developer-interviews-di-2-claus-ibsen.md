In the second edition of my developer interview series I had a chance to talk to Claus Ibsen (<a href="https://twitter.com/davsclaus" target="_blank">@davsclaus</a>). He works for Red Hat on open source integration software such as <a href="" target="_blank">JBoss Fuse</a> and is <a href="" target="_blank">Apache Camel</a> committer. You may also know him for his book "<a href="" target="_blank">Camel in Action</a>".
<br>
 We talked about his history in integration technologies and looked at the latest developments which are upcoming for the Camel 2.14 release which might get released in the September time-frame. Beside that he also showcased how to quickly run a demo with Maven and Eclipse and introduced us to the Camel module in hawtio.

 40 minutes is just about right for a coffee and your lunch break! Go, watch it!
