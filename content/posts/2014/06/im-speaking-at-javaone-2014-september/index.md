Just a short 104 days to go until the number one Java event is going to happen again. <a href="" target="_blank">JavaOne</a> opens it's doors again beginning 28th of September till the 2nd of October this year. After intense months of work in the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/javaone/program-committee/index.html" target="_blank">program committee</a> for both the Server-side Java and the Java in the Cloud track, where we dug through <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2014/05/javaone-2014-some-first-analysis-on.html" target="_blank">all the proposals</a> the final program has been selected and the notifications have been send out.
