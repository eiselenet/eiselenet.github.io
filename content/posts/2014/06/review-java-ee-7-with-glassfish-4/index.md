<br><b>The Content</b>
<br>
 This is actually the third edition of the book. All you need to know about Java EE 7 and latest GlassFish 4 release is packed into 11 chapters. Ranging from a getting started introduction with GlassFish to developing with latest Java EE 7 core technologies, like JSF, EJB and such it is also covering how to secure your applications. The 400 pages bring a net content of 313 real content (removing preface and appendix kind of stuff).&nbsp;It is a fast paced tutorial for Java EE 7.
<br>
<br><b>Writing and Style</b>
<br>
 &nbsp;If you are used to technical documentation you shouldn't struggle with this book. For a non native speaker it reads very easy and I didn't find very many complex sentences which stopped my reading. The examples always interrupt the overall reading flow but this book isn't meant to just be read. You need to get hands on the sample code and learn to use it.
<br>
<br><b>Conclusion and recommendation</b>
<br>
 The book is keeping things simple enough to make it easy to start with almost the complete platform at a beginner level, summing up the concepts and without getting intimidated. The large amount of sample code, examples and pictorial representations improve the understanding of the content a lot.
<br>
 It is an easy read and you can quickly work your way through it. Go get it, while it is hot!
