<br>
 A warm welcome to the FeedHenry Team at Red Hat!
<br>
<br><b>What is FeedHenry?</b>
<br>
 It is a cloud-based mobile application platform to design, develop, deploy and mobile applications. The platform provides specific services for security, notification and data synchronization. You can build hybrid apps not only for iOS, Android, Blackberry and Windows Phone mobile devices but
<br>
 also as web apps accessible from any browser. On top it enables developer to build access to corporate data and applications into those applications and build backend logic that supports their mobile applications.
<br>
<br><b>What are the technical components?</b>
<br>
 The open and extensible architecture is based on Node.js for client and server side mobile app development. It supports a wide variety of popular toolkits including native SDKs, hybrid <a href="" target="_blank">Apache Cordova</a>, HTML5 and Titanium, as well as frameworks such as <a href="" target="_blank">Xamarin</a>, <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch" target="_blank">Sencha Touch</a>, and other JavaScript frameworks. Out-of-the-box Node.js plugins are a set of best-in-class <a href="" target="_blank">Node.js</a> modules that have been tested and curated, ready for developers to cut and paste into their app projects. Those exist for things like Dropbox, Facebook, Google APIs, EC2, Remote Databases, SaaS Connectors,
<br>
