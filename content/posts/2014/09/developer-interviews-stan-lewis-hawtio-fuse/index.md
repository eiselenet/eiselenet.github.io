Already the fourth edition of my pod- and screencast crossover. Today it was Red Hatter Stan Lewis (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/gashcrumb" target="_blank">@gashcrumb</a>) who took some time to talk about his work and about the hot web-console which is the new front-end for all things JBoss <a href="" target="_blank">Fabric8</a>/<a href="" target="_blank">Fuse</a>. He is a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat and came on board with the Fusesource acquisition end of 2012. As one of the primary developers on the hawtio web console, an AngularJS web application written in Typescript for managing JVMs; he also work closely with the <a href="" target="_blank">Fabric8 </a>project to develop a poly-container deployment and management platform.
