In my evening hours I had the chance to talk to Jeff Genender (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/jgenender" target="_blank">@jgenender</a>)&nbsp;which resulted in a new episode of my developer interviews. We talked about all things Apache and integration and also a bit about Java EE and microservices and what today's customers want from a modern architecture.
