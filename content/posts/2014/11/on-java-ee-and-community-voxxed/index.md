Devoxx is nearly a wrap. Beside the general awesomeness, Stephan and his team launched a new content website to be the number one stop for all topics related to technologies which are relevant for Devoxx attendees. While I've been at GeeCon, Lucy asked me for an interview which I happily gave. So we get to chat about WildFly development and explains why the Java EE needs you. And about &nbsp;JBUGs (<a href="http://www.jboss.org/usergroups" target="_blank">http://www.jboss.org/usergroups</a>) and the <a href="" target="_blank">Virtual JBoss User Group</a>.
