</div> I am traveling a lot lately and catching up with the trip reports is not easy. One of my favorite trips lately was my visit in St. Petersburg, Russia for <a href="" target="_blank">Jokerconf</a>. It is one of the most technical and Java centered conferences I've seen in a while. The session schedule is an endless list of high quality speakers and topics. Given that, I was honored to present about Java EE and JavaScript while the organizers try to cover even more topics and platforms in the Java space.
<br>
 The biggest challenge was probably the preparation in this case. I had to get a visa and prepare for travel into a country which language isn't exactly near my own or even English. But the organizers did an amazing job and supported their international speakers. A big thank you for that, because without it it probably wouldn't have happened at all.
<br>
<br><b>The Venue</b>
<br>
 It is held in the Raddisson Park In Hotel which is a very large hotel roughly 4 km away from the airport. It's no surprise that it has a full blown conference venue build into it and there was everything you could wish for. The room sizes ranged from normal to the very large theater like keynote room.

<br><b>My Sessions</b>
<br>
 I gave two presentations about the "<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/myfear/50-best-features-of-java-ee-7-at-jokerconf" target="_blank">Best Features of Java EE 7</a>" and "<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/myfear/javascript-in-the-enterprise-at-jokerconf" target="_blank">JavaScript in the Enterprise</a>". Both very well attended and I got some questions afterwards. Find the slides for the sessions on my speakerdeck account. I am very much looking forward to attend next years version.

<br><b>Pictures</b>
<br>
 I tried to capture some impressions from the conference in a <a href="https://plus.google.com/100362024804331957185/posts/VSaQc8QQ57p">Google Plus story</a>. There is also a <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/100362024804331957185/albums/6072905704620994833" target="_blank">JokerConf album</a> on Google Plus if you want to get even more. It was fun to bring some WildFly, Java EE and JBoss to Russia! Thank you for having me!
