<br>
<br><b>General</b>
<br><i>Who are you?</i> (Describe yourself in max three sentences)
<br>
 I'm a freelance trainer and author teaching Java and C++. I'm based in Munich,&nbsp;Germany, but teaching wherever there is demand.
<br>
<br><i>Your official job title at your company?</i>
<br>
 Since I am self-employed there is no company that could provide me with a job&nbsp;title. &nbsp;If I wanted a job title I could simply invent one.
<br>
<br><i>Do you care about it?</i>
<br>
 No, I couldn't care less. &nbsp;Does anybody care? &nbsp;It always baffles me when people&nbsp;demand that I provide a job title. Like, for instance, each time I open a bank&nbsp;account or file a tax report I must invent a job title. &nbsp;So, I'm usually saying&nbsp;"trainer", which at one bank was filed as a sports-related profession, like I&nbsp;were a soccer trainer or something. &nbsp;I doubt that the bank had any serious&nbsp;interest in my job title; it is just a silly formality.
<br>
<br><i>Do you speak foreign languages? Which ones?</i>
<br>
 German is my native language and I am able to read, write, and talk in English,&nbsp;but beyond that ... nothing I would dare to use in a business context. Just&nbsp;some rudimentary knowledge of French and Italian.
<br>
<br><i>How long is your daily "bootstrap" process? (Coffee, news, email)</i>
<br>
 It depends on where I am on a given morning. 
<br>
<br>
 When I'm in Munich I brew a cup of coffee, nestle myself into one corner of the&nbsp;couch in my home office, and enjoy the morning sun, if any. &nbsp;No further&nbsp;bootstrap. &nbsp;It takes half an hour at most. 
<br>
<br>
 There were times when I rushed to the computer first thing in the morning and&nbsp;started reading and answering email even before my coffee had been brewn. &nbsp;I&nbsp;don't do this any more; it's not healthy. &nbsp;These days I take care of email and&nbsp;news in the afternoon or evening. My prime time, i.e. the morning hours, are&nbsp;devoted to work that requires substantial amounts of concentration and&nbsp;creativity such as coding, developing concepts, working on course materials,&nbsp;writing articles, etc. &nbsp;The chores such as email, tax declarations, business&nbsp;correspondence, etc. is routine and done later in the day.
<br>
<br>
 But, most of the time I wake up in a hotel room somewhere, take the usual hotel&nbsp;breakfast, grab my notebook, and walk to the customer site where I'll be running&nbsp;my seminar. &nbsp;No bootstrap at all. &nbsp;Email has to wait until evening hours -&nbsp;sometimes even until I return to the office if the seminar is exhausting.
<br>
<br><b>Twitter</b>
<br><i>You have a twitter handle? Why?</i>
<br>
 No, I don't use Twitter. &nbsp;Just the bare idea of reading and writing tweets in&nbsp;addition to what I'm already doing turns me off. &nbsp;I'm too busy and don't need&nbsp;any additional chores. 
<br>
<br>
 Also, I don't like the concept of Twitter. &nbsp;I studied their terms and conditions&nbsp;and learnt that Twitter claims full ownership of all tweets. &nbsp;Seemingly, I as&nbsp;the originator of a tweet would not have the right to modify or delete any of my&nbsp;tweets any time I desire to do so. &nbsp;It's an "interesting" concept that I&nbsp;personally do not feel comfortable with.
<br>
<br>
 I guess, in general, I lack the exhibitionist gene that is needed for exposing&nbsp;one's private parts in social networks. &nbsp;I do maintain a webpage whose content I&nbsp;own and fully control. &nbsp;I did create profiles at Linkedin and Xing many years&nbsp;ago out of curiosity, but I haven't used them much. &nbsp; But nothing beyond that.&nbsp;No Twitter, no Facebook, no nothing.
<br>
<br><b>Work</b>
<br><i>What's your daily development setup? (OS/IDE/VC/other Tools)</i>
<br>
 Nothing fancy. &nbsp;Windows7-64, the latest versions of either Java or C++, an&nbsp;editor, a text processor, a presentation tool for the seminar materials, and&nbsp;that's basically it. 
<br>
<br>
 For teaching and writing purposes I'm interested in understanding and evaluating&nbsp;tools and deliberately do not restrict myself to anything in particular. &nbsp;In&nbsp;general, I prefer open source or free tools (e.g. Eclipse, gnu, OpenJDK,&nbsp;LibreOffice) over commercial tools. &nbsp;Whatever I present is more helpful to the&nbsp;audience if they can actually and easily use and apply it. &nbsp;Where is the point&nbsp;in talking about a commercial tool that only few people in the audience will ever&nbsp;get a chance to use? &nbsp;Also, there are very mundane and practical reasons for not&nbsp;tying myself to anything in particular: I need to stay flexible and must adapt to&nbsp;the customer's toolset, for instance, each time I bring programs for the hands-on part of an in-house workshop. 
<br>
<br><i>Which is the tool providing most productivity to your work?</i>
<br>
 The advent of IDEs was an immense productivity boost. &nbsp;I still remember the&nbsp;stone age of software development on mainframes when as a developer I had to&nbsp;generate a cross reference of my source code, kindly asked for a printout from&nbsp;the computer centre services, and then flipped pages in a pile of paper at least&nbsp;20 cm thick in order to figure out which variable or method was used or defined&nbsp;where in the source code. &nbsp;Crazy! &nbsp;What a poor use of precious time ...
<br>
<br>
 So, I do very much appreciate the tools we have available these days. &nbsp;IDEs,&nbsp;browsers, JavaDoc, profilers, monitors, etc.
<br>
<br>
 And the internet, of course. &nbsp;The possibility to work remotely and easily share&nbsp;information with other people. &nbsp;The availability of information. &nbsp;Can anybody&nbsp;remember that entire teams had to share one hardcopy of a manual for information&nbsp;about protocols, APIs, and the like? 
<br>
<br><i>Your prefered way of interacting with co-workers?</i>
<br>
 Email. It's independent of time zones. &nbsp;I can read and write them whenever I see&nbsp;fit. I can archive them and search them if I can't remember their precise&nbsp;content. &nbsp;I can't keep all details in mind as I'm almost always handling a dozen&nbsp;threads in parallel. &nbsp;I need a means to remind myself what I discussed with&nbsp;whom.
<br>
<br>
 Consequently, I hate phone calls; they interrupt my flow of thought and work.&nbsp;Plus, they are more work than an email, because &nbsp;I need to take notes of what&nbsp;was discussed on the phone so that I can later look it up. 
<br>
<br><i>What's your favorite way of managing your todo's?</i>
<br>
 A piece of paper and hand written notes that I can cross out when done or throw&nbsp;away when obsolete. &nbsp;I need a visual and physical manifestation of my chores.&nbsp;Same for my schedule. It's a calendar with color-coded entries sitting on my&nbsp;desk. &nbsp;Everything that I consider important must sit on my desk. &nbsp;I even&nbsp;explicitly print documents just for the purpose of putting them onto my desk to&nbsp;remind myself that I still must take care of it. 
<br>
<br>
 It's similar to the decision between a hardcopy of a book and an e-book. &nbsp;Both&nbsp;forms have their merit. &nbsp;I prefer the hardcopy for reading the book and the&nbsp;electronic version as a reference for subsequent lookup.
<br>
<br><i>If you could make a wish for a job at your favourite company: What would that be?</i>
<br>
 I enjoy being self-employed and already have the job I desire.
<br>
<br><b>Java</b>
<br><i>You're programming in Java. Why?</i>
<br>
 Because it is a successful and popular programming language used by many&nbsp;companies and millions of developers. &nbsp;It would be difficult to make a living by&nbsp;teaching a programming language that hardly anybody is interested in.
<br>
<br><i>What's least fun with Java?</i>
<br>
 Lack of diagnostics from compiler and virtual machine. I miss a convenient and&nbsp;systematic way of retrieving information regarding compilation, optimization,&nbsp;garbage collection, thread management, and further compiler/JVM internals. But&nbsp;then, it's a property of the respective virtual machine implementation and not&nbsp;of Java, the programming language, itself. &nbsp;Regarding a programming language&nbsp;such as Java I don't think in terms of "fun". &nbsp;A programming language is a tool;&nbsp;I simply use it.
<br>
<br><i>If you could change one thing with Java, what would that be?</i>
<br>
 Let me quote Nick Cave: "I don't believe in an interventionist God." &nbsp;All&nbsp;decisions regarding Java were made for a reason that appeared good at the time&nbsp;when the decision was made. I respect that.
<br>
<br>
 One could argue that Generics could have been added much earlier, e.g. in Java&nbsp;1.2 instead of Java 5. &nbsp;No need for type erasure at that early point in time;&nbsp;generics were much easier to understand and use. &nbsp;However, given the&nbsp;circumstances, type erasure makes sense to me. That does not mean that I like&nbsp;type erasure or would suggest to change it.
<br>
<br><i>What's your personal&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;in dynamic languages?</i>
<br>
 Dynamic language? &nbsp;I strongly prefer statically typed languages. &nbsp;I feel&nbsp;uncomfortable if both the compiler and the runtime system do lots of stuff for&nbsp;me without telling me what is going on.
<br>
<br>
 Just as an anecdote: &nbsp;I gave a talk on lambda expressions in Java 8 recently and&nbsp;mentioned that variables from an enclosing context used inside a lambda&nbsp;expression are treated by the compiler as though they were declared final in the&nbsp;enclosing context - regardless of an explicit final declaration being present in&nbsp;the source code or not. &nbsp;These variables are "implicitly" final. &nbsp;How on earth&nbsp;would that be helpful? &nbsp;I would definitely prefer typing those five additional&nbsp;"final" characters to have a visible clue that the variable is final rather than
<br>
 having the compiler making it final silently behind my back. &nbsp;It is much clearer&nbsp;and more understandable if the source says what it means. &nbsp;I'm not entirely&nbsp;against type inference; it definitely has its merits in many situations, but&nbsp;Java was deliberately designed as a verbose language and nowadays this concept&nbsp;is no longer appreciated.
<br>
<br><i>Which programming technique has moved you forwards most and why?</i>
<br>
 Templates in C++. &nbsp;Eventually I could get rid of code replication by means of&nbsp;intelligent use of templates.
<br>
<br><i>What was the biggest project you've ever worked on?</i>
<br>
 I'm not sure. &nbsp;I guess, the biggest one probably was the compiler family that&nbsp;included the C++ compiler to which I contributed. &nbsp;So, it was compiler&nbsp;construction, which explains my sustained interest in language and library&nbsp;evolution.
<br>
<br><i>Which was the worst programming mistake you did?</i>
<br>
 Not testing my programs diligently enough in order to make sure that I detect the&nbsp;mistakes before the client does.
