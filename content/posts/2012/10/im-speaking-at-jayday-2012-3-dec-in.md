</div> With Java EE 7 cloud should have been added to the specification. Allowing for a broad ecosystem of PaaS providers to jump on the train. Because of the missing maturity and field experiences this has been delayed to EE 8. However there are some offerings on the market already. This talk throws light onto how they differentiate from each other and which ones are the right ones for Java EE. Featuring: CloudBees, OpenShift, Elastic Beanstalk, Jelastic and Oracle Java Service.
