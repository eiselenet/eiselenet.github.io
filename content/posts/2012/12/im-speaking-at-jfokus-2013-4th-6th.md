It's my pleasure to announce that I will be speaking at next years Jfokus again! Jfokus is the largest annual conference for everyone who works with Java in Sweden. The conference is arranged together with Javaforum Stockholm. Javaforum is a Swedish developer community and an official Java User Group (JUG) with premier purpose is to support Swedish developers. During three days, you will have an unique opportunity to keep yourself updated with the latest development of the Java platform through numerous interesting sessions.

<br>
 I have the pleasure to help Arun Gupta with his famous Hands-On-Lab
<br><b><a href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/talks.jsp?lang=en#Hands-on Lab: Developing JAX-RS Web Applications Utilizing Server-Sent Events and WebSocket" target="_blank">Developing JAX-RS Web Applications Utilizing Server-Sent Events and WebSocket</a></b>
<br>
 This hands-on lab guides attendees through building a Web application with the new JAX-RS 2.0 API. It shows how to use some value-added features of Jersey (the open source JAX-RS reference implementation) and Tyrus (the early draft implementation of Java API for WebSocket [JSR 356]) for leveraging HTML5 technologies such as server-sent events and WebSocket. 
<br>
 Which already is fully booked at the time of writing :)
<br>
<br>
 Further on I will be at the
<br><b><a href="http://www.jfokus.se/jfokus/talks.jsp?lang=en#Java EE.express BOF" target="_blank">Java EE.express BOF</a></b>
<br>
 Together with Oracle's Mike Keith I will listen to community feedback. It is a perfect opportunity for developers to express their views about the overall direction of Java EE, as well as make suggestions for features and improvements to individual specifications.
<br>
 Come out and be heard? or just listen to what others have to say and assert your agreement/disagreement over their opinions!
<br><b>We are here to listen!</b>
