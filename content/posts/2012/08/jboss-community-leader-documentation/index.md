Thought I share this one with you :) During my visit to <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2012/06/judcon-trip-report-2012.html">JUDCon</a> we recorded an interview about <a href="http://www.jboss.org/arquillian.html" target="_blank">Arquillian</a> and my engagement with the project. Thanks again for the great time there! It was a pleasure!
