Flights are booked and everything else is arranged. I am truly looking forward to the no one Java event in one of my favorite cities in the states. Moving this from a placeholder to the final state took some time this year. The schedule still isn't finished and all the last minute changes are dropping in. If you are looking for me try to find me at one of the mentioned places and sessions. Beside this I will most likely run around "The Zone" or attend some of the great sessions.

<br><b>JavaOne San Francisco Geek Bike Ride</b>
<br>
 If it happens, that you are a bike fan and would love to bike the bridge you can think about joining this years JavaOne San Francisco Geek Bike Ride.
<br>
 All you have to do is to register (for free) with&nbsp;<a href="">http://sfgeekbikeride.eventbrite.com/</a>&nbsp;and enjoy the best the Bay Area has to offer by riding a bicycle across the Golden Gate Bridge.
<br>
 We will meet at <a href="http://www.blazingsaddles.com/san-francisco.aspx">Blazing Saddles</a>&nbsp;at Fisherman's Wharf and ride across the bridge and down into Sausalito, and then take a ferry back to the city.
<br>
 This is a beginner/intermediate ride, roughly 8 miles and takes 1.5 hours to ride. I expect we'll have several photograph stops, and we'll stop for a treat in Sausalito. There are three big hills (two steep ones going up Fort Mason and the approach to the bridge, and one fun downhill into Sausalito), but (obviously) the bridge is flat and easy. The hardest part may be dodging pedestrians on the bridge!
<br>
 All geeks and their friends are invited.
<br>
<br>
 Meet at Blazing Saddles bikes at 2715 Hyde St. If you want to reserve a particular bike, you can reserve it in advance online. Bike rental is $30-$40 USD, there's a 10% discount if you reserve online. The ferry is $10.50 USD.
