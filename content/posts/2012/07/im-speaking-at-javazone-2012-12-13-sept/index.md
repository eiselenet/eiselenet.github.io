For the first time ever I am going to present at this years <a href="" target="_blank">JavaZone</a> in Oslo, Norway. JavaZone is the biggest meeting place for software developers in Scandinavia, and one of Europe's most important.

</div> JavaZone has been described as a high quality, independent conference - a leading forum for knowledge exchange for IT-professionals. Each year around 2,300 conference tickets are sold. This years JavaZone is the eleventh and surely not the last.
