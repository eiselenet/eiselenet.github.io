For the first time ever, <a href="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DOAG e.V.</a> is organizing a conference for the exchange of experiences for software developers. On 14 June 2012, the Maritim Hotel Bonn hosts the German Oracle development scene. Be there and dive deep into the software development using tools and technologies from Oracle!
