One of the few posts for the German audience of my blog. Last week it happened to be, that I had the honor of giving a webcast/webinar about how we use SCRUM in our daily work. This was a session done together with Dr. Stephan Frohnhoff (member of the board of directors at the msg systems ag).

</div> He started with giving a brief overview about what SCRUM is in theory and what to look out for. After that I had the pleasure to talk about one of my projects from last year and how we managed to integrate SCRUM there. The recording of the complete one and a half hour webinar is <a href="" target="_blank">available for free online</a> (German only). A short <a href="" target="_blank">German review about the session</a> which roughly had 35 attendees is also available online. It was big fun doing and I was really glad to had the chance of doing this. Beside the fact that it uses Adobe's Connect (and the replay isn't available for iOS devices) it was surprisingly easy to do and I was also very happy about the quality of both audio and video. Happy to read your thoughts about it!
