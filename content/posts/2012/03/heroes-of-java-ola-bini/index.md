Time to catch up with my "<a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/09/heroes-of-java.html">Heroes of Java</a>" interview series. The 14the part is dedicated to Ola Bini. The London JUG connection made this interview possible (Thanks <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/09/heroes-of-java-martijn-verburg.html">Martijn</a>) because I sadly never met Ola in person until today.

<br>
<br><b>General Part</b>
<br><i>Who are you?</i>
<br>
 I'm a Swedish programming language geek living in Chicago!
<br>
<br><i>Your offical job title at your company?</i>
<br>
 Well, it says "Computational Meta-linguist" on my business cards. =)
<br>
<br><i>Do you care about it?</i>
<br>
 Absolutely. I work as a consultant for ThoughtWorks and there are many&nbsp;really good things about it.
<br>
<br><i>Do you speak foreign languages? Which ones?</i>
<br>
 Swedish. Although strictly, I guess English is the foreign language for&nbsp;me, since Swedish is my mother tongue.
<br>
<br><i>How long is your daily "bootstrap" process?&nbsp;</i>
<br>
 Well. 0 or infinity. I do it continuously with other things.
<br>
<br><b>Twitter</b>
<br><i>You have a twitter handle? Why?</i>
<br><a href="http://www.twitter.com/olabini" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@olabini</a>&nbsp;why not? =)
<br>
<br><i>Whom are you following in general?</i>
<br>
 Mostly contacts or interesting people in the computing industry.
<br>
<br><i>Do you have a personal "policy" for twitter?</i>
<br>
 Not really.
<br>
<br><i>Does your company restricts or encourages you with your twitter ussage?</i>
<br>
 We are encouraged to build our personal brands, and using Twitter is&nbsp;definitely a part of that.
<br>
<br><b>Work</b>
<br>
 What's your daily development setup? (OS/IDE/VC/other Tools)
<br><i>Mac OS X, Emacs, Terminal (with ZSh). Everything else is incidental.</i>
<br>
<br><i>Which is the tool providing most productivity to your work?</i>
<br>
 Emacs, without a doubt.
<br>
<br><i>Your prefered way of interacting with co-workers?</i>
<br>
 Pair programming.
<br>
<br><i>What's your favorite way of managing your todo's?</i>
<br>
 I use the iOS Reminders app for a lot of things, and I use Emacs
<br>
 org-mode for most things.
<br>
<br><i>If you could make a wish for a job at your favorite company: What would that be?</i>
<br>
 I already work for my favorite company!
<br>
<br><b>Java</b>
<br><i>You're programming in Java. Why?</i>
<br>
 I'm programming in many languages - I do Java because it's a pragmatic&nbsp;choice in many regards. The power of the JVM is really the reason I use&nbsp;Java.
<br>
<br><i>What's least fun with Java?</i>
<br>
 How verbose and limited the language is.
<br>
<br><i>If you could change one thing with Java, what would that be?</i>
<br>
 I would like to stop it from changing completely - I want Oracle to do a&nbsp;non-backwards compatible Java-like language instead.
<br>
<br><i>What's your personal favorite in dynamic languages?</i>
<br>
 Lisp.
<br>
<br><i>Which programming technique has moved you forwards most and why?</i>
<br>
 That's really hard to say. I don't actually know.
<br>
<br><i>What was the biggest project you've ever worked on?</i>
<br>
 In terms of people or lines of code? I worked on a team with about 25
<br>
 Ruby developers for a while. In terms of largest in LOCs, that varies a
<br>
 lot from language to language, so it's hard to make comparisons.
<br>
<br><i>Which was the worst programming mistake you did?</i>
<br>
 There are so many to choose from! Most of my mistakes during my career
<br>
 has actually been social and political rather than technical.
