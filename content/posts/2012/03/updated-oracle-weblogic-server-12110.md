Sources told me that as of Friday last week you have an updated version of <a href="http://otn.oracle.com/weblogic" target="_blank">WebLogic Server 12c on OTN</a>. This is still at 12.1.1.0 but has been repackaged to include some additional patches and is delivered as a "pre-patched" distribution. For x86 based 64bit systems the Oracle support site lists 19 single patches are available.

</div> Anyway, the preferred approach is to use the updated WebLogic Server 12.1.1 distribution. If you obtain the updated product distribution for WebLogic Server 12.1.1 after March 16, 2012, the patches are included.&nbsp;If you obtained a product distribution for WebLogic Server 12.1.1 prior to March 16, 2012, and you do not wish to re-install with the updated WebLogic Server distribution, you can obtain the patches from My Oracle Support.
<br>
<br>
 Mainly four areas have been corrected with the patches. You now have a bunch of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/doc.1211/e26593/issues.htm#BCFJFDCG" target="_blank">JDK 7 certification patches</a> some <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/doc.1211/e26593/issues.htm#BCFJIGBB" target="_blank">Contexts and Dependency Injection patches</a> the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/doc.1211/e26593/issues.htm#BCFJDDHG" target="_blank">Deployment performance optimization patches</a> and last but not least the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/doc.1211/e26593/issues.htm#BCFCIEJG" target="_blank">Developer experience patch</a> which only applies to the developer-only distribution.
