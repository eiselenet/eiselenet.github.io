One more to go until my "<a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/09/heroes-of-java.html">Heroes of Java</a>" series reaches the 20. No 19 is reserved for "Mr.Time and Date". With him <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2012/08/i-am-nominated-for-10th-jcp-annual.html">also being nominated</a> for this years annual JCP Awards as "Member of the Year" I finally had the chance to send him my little interview. Thanks for taking the time Stephen!

</div> is a Member of Technical Staff at OpenGamma. He is widely known for his work in open source and his blog. He created Joda-Time which is now being further developed as JSR-310/ThreeTen. He contributes to debates on the future of Java, including proposals for the diamond operator for generics and FCM closures, both of which are close to the adopted changes in Java 7 and 8. Stephen is a frequent conference speaker, JavaOne Rock Star and Java Champion.
<br>
<br><b>General Part</b>
<br><i>Who are you?</i>
<br>
 Stephen Colebourne. Java Champion, conference speaker, spec lead of&nbsp;JSR-310 dates and times, creator of the Joda Open Source projects, and&nbsp;occasional blogger of controversial topics.
<br>
<br><i>Your offical job title at your company?</i>
<br>
 Member of Technical Staff
<br>
<br><i>Do you care about it?</i>
<br>
 OpenGamma is an open source company. We are producing software for the&nbsp;finance industry, helping banks and hedge funds work out how risky&nbsp;their investments are. Being radically open in my work life means that
<br>
 work is an extension of my other open source projects and I, or anyone&nbsp;else, can re-use the code I'm writing.
<br>
<br><i>Do you speak foreign languages? Which ones?</i>
<br>
 I speak about 100 words of French, 10 words of German and 5 words of&nbsp;Dutch and Swedish. In other words I'm a typical person from the UK.
<br>
<br><i>How long is your daily "bootstrap" process? (Coffee, news, email)</i>
<br>
 I'm cutting down on some of the waste here at the moment, but it still&nbsp;takes too long. Email is the biggest headache, when it frequently&nbsp;contains issues to be investigated.
<br>
<br><b>Twitter</b>
<br><i>You have a twitter handle? Why?</i>
<br><a href="http://twitter.com/jodastephen" target="_blank">@jodastephen</a>. I reserved the handle as it was clearly a name-grab, and&nbsp;I didn't want anyone stealing my name. I was generally unconvinced&nbsp;until I spoke to someone who explained twitter as an advertising&nbsp;medium. From there I effectively use it to advertise my point of view.
<br>
<br><i>Whom are you following in general?</i>
<br>
 A few people. I don't really "follow" people - its more a list of&nbsp;people that will get news and information to me quickly.
<br>
<br>
 Do you have a personal "policy" for twitter?
<br>
 I don't think twitter really is a social medium. Its just a&nbsp;broadcast/opinion one. Its most effective at disseminating news. The&nbsp;key thing is to keep your feed focussed - have a second feed if you&nbsp;have a second interest in life.
<br>
<br><i>Does your company restricts or encourages you with your twitter ussage?</i>
<br>
 OpenGamma is happy to encourage twitter usage within sensible bounds.
<br>
<br><b>Work</b>
<br><i>What's your daily development setup? (OS/IDE/VC/other Tools)</i>
<br>
 Eclipse on Windows, with SmartGit. I used to dislike git, but now I&nbsp;think its great. Trouble is that it took a week of deep-dive into git&nbsp;commands porting broken svn repositories to git for me to understand&nbsp;what the heck git was really all about. Its that usability that still&nbsp;worries me, but SmartGit makes it tolerable now day to day.
<br>
<br><i>Which is the tool providing most productivity to your work?</i>
<br>
 I guess that is Eclipse, although git is helpful these days.
<br>
<br><i>Your prefered way of interacting with co-workers?</i>
<br>
 I walk over and talk. My legs need stretching and its not far. If its&nbsp;non-urgent I'd send an email. I don't like IM.
<br>
<br><i>What's your favorite way of managing your todo's?</i>
<br>
 Starred items in Gmail and a paper list of TODO items that I cross&nbsp;off. A simple online issue tracker can work, trying the GitHub one&nbsp;right now for JSR-310.
<br>
<br><i>If you could make a wish for a job at your favorite company: What would that be?</i>
<br>
 Once upon a time I wanted to be paid just to write low-level library&nbsp;open source. Now I'm not so sure. Having customers and a focus is&nbsp;important to be able to see code being used.
<br>
<br><b>Java</b>
<br><i>You're programming in Java. Why?</i>
<br>
 Its the world's enterprise language of choice. Being in the mainstream&nbsp;makes sense to me.
<br>
<br><i>What's least fun with Java?</i>
<br>
 Almost everything! No seriously, Java is a poor language at this point&nbsp;compared to other languages out there. It is unnecessarily verbose in&nbsp;many places and hasn't tackled the real issues developers face,&nbsp;including null pointers, type conversion, properties and the most&nbsp;basic operator overloading.
<br>
<br><i>If you could change one thing with Java, what would that be?</i>
<br>
 In terms of the pain, duplicated code and general waste in Java&nbsp;developers lives, properties are by far the most important feature&nbsp;missing. They should have been added in preference to generics and in&nbsp;preference to lambdas.
<br>
<br><i>What's your personal favorite in dynamic languages?</i>
<br>
 If I had to use one, it would be Groovy, although I really don't have&nbsp;a need to do so. Basic static typing is far too useful to throw away.&nbsp;The problem is some developers in today's "more, more, more" society&nbsp;think that more static typing is helpful, when most of the time it&nbsp;simply results in humans trying to second guess compilers. By&nbsp;contrast, throwing static typing away for a dynamic language is giving&nbsp;up on a tool that stops many, many simple errors. Why would I want to&nbsp;give up on that? The most interesting languages have static typing but&nbsp;feel dynamic, such as Fantom.
