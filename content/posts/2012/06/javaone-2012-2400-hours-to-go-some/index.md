As you might have seen the <a href="https://oracleus.activeevents.com/connect/search.ww?event=javaone">JavaOne 2012 Content Catalog</a> is online. The Program Committee had some very intense weeks of sorting, reviewing, rating and discussing <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2012/04/javaone-2012-analysis-submitted.html">every single proposal</a> and we finally managed to setup a (hopefully) interesting mix for you.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">With exactly 105 days or 2400 hours to go I thought it could be a good day to offer you a list of my favorites to come.</span>

 I had the pleasure to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/quick-links/program-committee/index.html" target="_blank">work with two teams</a> on the program tracks this year so you will get some recommendations for both the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/program/schedule/tracks/index.html#javaee">Java EE Web Profile and Platform Technologies</a> and the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/program/schedule/tracks/index.html#esa" target="_blank">Enterprise Service Architectures and the Cloud</a> track. Let's start with the first one.
<br>
<br><b>Java EE Web Profile and Platform Technologies</b>
<br>
 This track has 64 sessions, 31 BoFs and 6 tutorials overall. It's hard to highlight the right ones here without being unfair to anybody. All the speakers did a great job in submitting their proposals and it was amazingly hard to pick the final ones. Even if I have my favorites I highly encourage you to look at all the content in this track to make your own decisions!
