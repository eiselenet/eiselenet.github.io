<a href="http://bit.ly/bFw1j1" target="_blank">FireFox 3.6.2 is available</a>. This was my start to play around with a new feature available since some time. It is called <a href="http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/getting_started" target="_blank">Personas</a>. Personas are easy-to-install, easy-to-use themes that change the look of your Firefox web browser. There are thousands of Personas to choose from, with more added every day. Click here to visit the Personas gallery and start looking for designs that fit your style. 
<br>
 All you have to do is to install the <a href="http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/#plus" target="_blank">personas add-on</a> and restart your FF.
<br>
 Now you can choose different styles from the <a href="http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/gallery" target="_blank">growing gallery</a> or even <a href="http://www.getpersonas.com/en-US/demo_create" target="_blank">create your own</a>.

 I tried this today. And this is, what I came up with. Hope, you like it :)
<br>
 And no: This is not available for Download. I don't want to get in trouble with Oracle at all. I think it would be good idea to ask <a href="http://twitter.com/oracletechnet" target="_blank">@oracletechnet</a> (Justin Kestelyn) if you would like to have an official OTN/Oracle FireFox persona :)
