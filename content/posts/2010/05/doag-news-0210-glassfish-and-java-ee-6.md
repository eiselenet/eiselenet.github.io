The latest DOAG News, which is the quarterly magazin from the German Oracle users Group <a href="http://www.doag.org/?content=_engl" target="_blank">DOAG</a> e.V. published an article of mine. This is about GlassFish and Java EE 6 at Oracle and is ment as a guide to Java EE 6 and the "new" Oracle product. Beside this I wrote about some things seen along the road from Sun to Oracle.
