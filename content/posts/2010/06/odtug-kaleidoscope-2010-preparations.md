Roughly two weeks to go now. <a href="">ODTUG Kaleidoscope 2010</a> is ahead and the excitement is rising. Flights are booked. Waiting for some more information about hotel and transfer, but they will arrive in time. I am shure :) More than 170 technical sessions make it hard to choose. About 60 ACE Directors are presenting, too. Before they ran out of seats, I took the chance to collect&nbsp; my favorite sessions today.

<br>
 As expected, I will mostly attend the <a href="http://odtugkaleidoscope.com/middletier.html">Middle Tier and Client-Side Development</a> track. And this is the plan up to now:
<br>
<ul>
 <li>BPM in 2010 - Myths and Reality (Hajo Normann)</li>
 <li>Cutting Edge, AJAX Web UIs without the Headache (Juan Ruiz)</li>
 <li>Attention Oracle Developers: Find those Java Memory Leaks Fast! (Mark Prichard)</li>
 <li>Java EE Development with Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse (Greg Stachnick)</li>
 <li>What Makes a Service a Good Service? (Torsten Winterberg)</li>
 <li>Just Get it Written: Deploying Applications to WebLogic Server Using JDeveloper and WLS Console&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Peter Koletzke copresenter: Duncan Mills, Oracle)</li>
 <li>What’s Hot and What’s Not – An Overview of Oracle Development Tools (Sten Vesterli)</li>

</ul>I will be an ambassador for fellow ACE Directors Hajo and Torsten. Hopefully they don't mind that I am doing the job :)

<br>
 As usual, I will twitter and blog about the few days in Washington, D.C. You can follow me on twitter (<a href="">@myfear</a>) and please don't forget to follow the official ODTUG twitter account (<a href="">@ODTUG</a>).
<br>
 If this still is not enough, you can also search for the <a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23ODTUG">#ODTUG hashtag</a> and listen, what others have to say about the conference.
