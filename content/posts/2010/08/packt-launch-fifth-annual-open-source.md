The <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home" target="_blank">2010 Open Source Awards</a> was launched by Packt, inviting people to <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home/nominations" target="_blank">submit nominations</a> for their favorite Open Source project. Now in its fifth year, the Award has been adapted from the established Open Source CMS Award with the wider aim of encouraging, supporting, recognizing and rewarding all Open Source projects.

</div>WordPress won the 2009 Open Source Content Management System (CMS) Award in what was a very close contest with MODx and SilverStripe. While MODx was the first runner up, SilverStripe, a Most Promising CMS Award winner in 2008, made its way to the second runner up position in its first year in the Open Source CMS Award final.

<br>
 The 2010 Award will feature a prize fund of $24,000 with several new categories introduced. While the Open Source CMS Award category will continue to recognize the best content management system, Packt is introducing categories for the <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home/most-promising-open-source-project-resources" target="_blank">Most Promising Open Source Project</a>, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home/open-source-ecommerce-applications-resources" target="_blank">Open Source E-Commerce Applications</a>, <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home/open-source-javascript-libraries-resources" target="_blank">Open Source JavaScript Libraries</a> and <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home/open-source-graphic-software-resources" target="_blank">Open Source Graphics Software</a>.
<br>
<br>
 CMSes that won the Overall CMS Award in previous years will continue to compete against one another in the Hall of Fame CMS category.
<br>
<br>
 These new categories will ensure that the Open Source Awards is the ultimate platform to recognise excellence within the community while supporting projects both new and old. “We believe that the adaption of the Award and the new categories will provide a new level of accessibility, with the Award recognizing a wider range of Open Source projects; both previous winners while at the same time, encouraging new projects” said Julian Copes, organizer of this year’s Awards.
<br>
<br>
 Packt has opened up nominations for people to submit their favorite Open Source projects for each category at <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home" target="_blank">www.packtpub.com/open-source-awards-home</a> . The top five in each category will go through to the final, which begins in the last week of September.
