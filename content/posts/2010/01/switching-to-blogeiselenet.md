As Google/Blogger will discontinue the ftp publishing I need to switch this blog, too.
<br>
 If you have problems accessing it, you know why. Will post, when it is back online :) Thanks for your patience!
<br>
<br>
 Status: 
<br>
 New adress: <a href="">http://blog.eisele.net/</a>. Is active. The content under www.eisele.net/blog/ is still available. I am going to redirect requests to files there during the next few days ...
<br>
<br>
 Some tips for changing from ftp publishing to custom domain settings:
<br>
 1) Add your CNAME DNS entries a few days before actually switching.
<br>
 2) Switch from ftp to blogspot hosting and after that to custom domain
<br>
 3) Use feedburner or comparable for your feeds
<br>
 4) Add new sitemaps to googles webmaster tools
<br>
 5) Add a permanent redirect with .htaccess
