Even if I still did not get my confirmation it is time to use the so called summer hole (even in germany we call it like this :)) to browse around and get ready for the number one event with Oracle and Java. This is a brief list of things to remember, to do, to see and links to visit prior or during your stay at one of the three conferences in San Francisco this year.

<br><b>Visiting the US - p&amp;p</b>
<br>
 Get yoursel a <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/visa_1750.html">visa </a>or at last an <a href="" target="_blank">esta certificate</a>.
<br>
 Make yourself familiar with the needed prerequisites for entering the US. The <a href="">http://travel.state.gov/</a> is a great source of information. If you are unshure about anything, ask the US embassy in your home country. They are very helpful (at last in germany). It is not too big trouble to enter the US but you need some <b>papers </b>and <b>patience</b>. Be shure to have everything needed to enter the US weeks before entering the plane. That saves you a lot of pain.
<br>
<br><b>Staying in San Francisco</b>
<br>
 For your convenience, Oracle has negotiated the lowest rates possible for Oracle OpenWorld San Francisco 2010. So it is possibly the best to check the official <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/openworld/062348.html" target="_blank">Oracle OpenWorld 2010 Housing</a> page for the latest information. There is a <a href="http://www28.cplan.com/oracle/oow10/hotel_list.htm" target="_blank">list with the offical conference hotels</a>, where you should find a place to take a nap. You should book as early as possible. 
<br>
<br><b>Onsite</b>
<br>
 Make a plan! <a href="http://www.eventreg.com/cc250/main.jsp">Content catalog</a>. All sessions will be accessible only if you have scheduled them within your schedule builder. You can access this thing through the <a href="http://www.eventreg.com/oracle/openworld2010/sanfrancisco/myreg" target="_blank">registration page</a>. Don't be a fool and simply try to rush into any session withou prior registration. That will not work in most of the cases (even if in some it will).
<br>
<br><b>must-attend</b>
<br>
 There are many smaller to bigger events happening around OOW, J1 and OD in SF. The ones, you can't afford to miss are the following:
<br>

<br><b>walking around in SF</b>
<br>
 Even if you schedule is packed, you have to walk around a bit in SF. It's easy and you should not miss this opportunity. There are many sources of information avalable about visiting San Francisco. I personaly like to use printed visitor guides in my own language. But there is also a hugh amount of information online. The <a href="" target="_blank">local's Guide for People Visiting SF</a> is a good example. All the online sources are not intended to substitute for your own good judgement. Take care of yourself and try to be a nice visitor. The SF people know what's happending during OOW. If you carry your badge around, you will find some stores where you get a rebate on your shopping. Watch out for more information on this. 
<br>
<br><b>must-see</b>
<br>
 My personal "must-see"s are:
<br><a href="" target="_blank">The San Francisco Cable Cars</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">Fishermans Wharf</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">Alcatraz Island</a>. If you are into buildings or photography you could also run around and look for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_in_San_Francisco" target="_blank">tallest buildings in San Francisco</a>. Except the Alcatraz tour all this are easy good for easy visiting. You don't have to register or walk around too much and they fit into a free afternoon. But please remember: There are so many other things to see! Take the time to make up your own "must-see" list before visiting. It's worth it!
<br>
<br><b>afterwards</b>
<br><a href="">On demand preview</a> gives you a first idea about the information you get from the <a href="http://www.cplan.com/oracleopenworld2009/sanfrancisco/ondemandlogon" target="_blank">On demand</a> website during and after the show. You have to register for this option and pay a bit but it's worth it. You can search all sessions from one central repository. See
<br>
 Keynotes, General Sessions and Executive Solution Sessions as streaming video with synchronized slides, scrolling transcripts, and downloadable MP3s and MP4s, look at 
<br>
 1700+ Conference Sessions in streaming audio with downloadable MP3s PowerPoints, white papers and more.
