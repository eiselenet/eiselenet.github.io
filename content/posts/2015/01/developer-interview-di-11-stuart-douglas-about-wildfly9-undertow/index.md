You know, that I am a Java EE guy. And I love looking into what comes up with latest servers. JBoss is working on <a href="" target="_blank">WildFly 9</a> these days, and one particular area that always caught my interest is scaling, clustering and failover. So, this is a great chance to look at what the new version of <a href="" target="_blank">Untertow</a> will have to offer. And it is my pleasure to welcome Stuart Douglas to my developer interview series.

 Stuart (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/stuartwdouglas" target="_blank">@stuartwdouglas</a>) is a Senior Software Engineer at Red Hat working on the Wildfly and JBoss EAP application servers. In his 4 years at Red Hat Stuart has worked on many parts of the server, including EJB, Servlets and Websockets. Stuart currently leads the Undertow project, which is an embeddable high performance web server used by Wildfly.
