New Year, new developer interviews. Yesterday evening I had the pleasure to talk to&nbsp;Görkem Ercan&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/gorkemercan" target="_blank">@gorkemercan</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">blog</a>) who is a Toronto based software engineer with Red Hat.&nbsp;has tens of years of experience working on software projects with different technologies ranging from enterprise and mobile Java to Symbian and Qt C++. He specializes on providing tools and APIs for developers. He works in the JBoss Developer Studio (JBDS) and is focused on the Cordova tooling. After my first experiences with mobile and such with the Devoxx keynote team, I thought it might be a good idea to look into what JBDS offers and if he can get me excited about it. I can tell you one thing: He made it.

 Sit back, relax and get a #Coffee+++! Thanks&nbsp;Görkem&nbsp; for taking the time!
