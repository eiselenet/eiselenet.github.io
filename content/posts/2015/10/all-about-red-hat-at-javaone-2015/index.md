</div> A little under a week before I jump on a plane and make my way to San Francisco again. As you might have guessed it is not only because of the beautiful city but because: It's JavaOne time! And we're pretty excited to be there again as Red Hat. We planned a lot of exciting activities for the attendees and hope to make a real difference with content and our presence in the exhibition hall. This &nbsp;post should be your guide to all the Red Hat content and activieties for the JavaOne week and I can't wait to see you getting excited about it. As usual for an overview, I might be missing things. Please feel free to reach out and I'll get the information added. If you haven't registered so far there is still plenty of time to consider a visit. Find more information on the <a href="" target="_blank">offical JavaOne website</a> and on the <a href="" target="_blank">JavaOne blog</a>.

<br><b>Come To Our Booth</b>

</div> First and foremost: Come to our booth! Located in the exhibition hall (Hilton San Francisco, Grand Ballroom) next to the Java Hub. Number 5101! We're dressed in all red and white and there's swag and a mini-theater with some cool sessions from our engineers attending JavaOne. There will be plenty of people from the community around to talk to and answer all your questions. If you just want to come bye and say hello, you're more than welcome. You can register to become a Red Hat Developer and I'm not unveiling a lot if I tell you that we will have a very cool t-shirt to give a way. It is a special 20-years-of-java edition! You can't afford to let this go. And there will be another great thing to grab. You probably have heard of me writing a little book: A book about Java EE and Modern Design pattern. It is distributed as a e-book from the 10/25 and I will let you know the download link: But if you happen to be there, please stop by and get your personal hard-copy of it!

<br>
 As usual, there are a lot of our engineers at JavaOne. Please feel free to reach out to them, give feedback, ask questions and network as this is a perfect opportunity to make yourself heard. I wouldn't be too surprised to see many if not all of them dropping by our booth regularly. That's your goto!
