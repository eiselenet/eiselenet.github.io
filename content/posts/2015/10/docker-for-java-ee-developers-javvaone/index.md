Instead of writing a blogpost, I should be cleaning and packing. Actually, JavaOne is just around the corner and beside my <a href="https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?event=javaone&amp;search=%22Markus%20Eisele%22&amp;search.event=javaoneEvent" target="_blank">own two sessions</a> about Apache Camel and the future of integration, I'm really looking forward to the Docker for Java EE developers Hands On Lab. A lot of preparations went into this one and it has been given some times before, but this is actually the first time that Rafael and I get a chance to run through the complete revamped version of it.
<br>
 And to get you excited for it, we did a tiny little recording with some first Docker basics and demos from the lab yesterday. Sit back, relax and get a #coffee+++!

<br><b>Docker for Java EE Developers [HOL7249]</b>
<br>
 Wednesday, Oct 28, 3:00 p.m. | Hilton—Franciscan Room B/C/D
<br>
 Containers are enabling developers to package their applications in new ways that are portable and work consistently everywhere: on your machine, in production, in your data center, and in the cloud. And Docker has become the de facto standard for those portable containers in the cloud. This lab offers developers an intro-level hands-on session with Docker, from installation to exploring Docker Hub, to crafting their own images, to adding Java apps and running custom containers. This is a BYOL (bring your own laptop) session, so bring your Windows, OS X, or Linux laptop and be ready to dig into a tool that promises to be at the forefront of our industry for some time to come.
