Now, that the <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2015/12/red-hat-eap7-public-beta-early-access.html" target="_blank">beta of latest Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform7</a> is out, it is about time to explore the available Java EE 7&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts" target="_blank">quickstarts</a>&nbsp;and deploy your first application with <a href="" target="_blank">JBoss Developer Studio</a> (JDBS).
<br>
 The quickstarts demonstrate JBoss EAP, Java EE 7 and a few additional technologies. They provide small, specific, working examples that can be used as a reference for your own project.
<br>
<br>
 To make it a <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2015/11/getting-started-with-eap-7-alpha-and.html" target="_blank">quick start</a> for you, I recorded a little 6 minute screencast about how to use JDBS to deploy the HelloWorld quickstart.

<br>
 The quickstarts cover a lot more. So. make sure to check all of them and <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/blob/7.0.x-develop/README.md" target="_blank">read the documentation</a> before you start working with them.

They also need to accept the terms and conditions of the JBoss Developer Program which provides $0 subscriptions for development use only.
