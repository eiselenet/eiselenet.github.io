</div> It has been an amazing year for me. With 31 trips to 13 countries and a total of 110k miles traveled, I have seen a lot of places and spoken at many conferences and user groups. I had the pleasure to talk to many many people and learned a lot about technology and community. The main topics in my past year have been the Red Hat JBoss middleware integration technologies. Mixing those with my Java EE knowledge and also look into new topics like microservices made this a very fast paced year.

 Social Media is a significant part of my daily life. Mostly because of the many inspirations and I think that it is a very quick and convenient way to catch up with latest happenings and developments. Beside tweeting from <a href="http://www.twitter.com/myfear" target="_blank">@myfear</a> I also look after the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jbossdeveloper" target="_blank">@jbossdeveloper</a> handle. And help run the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/vjbug" target="_blank">@vjbug</a>. Feel free to catch up with any of them and stay updated with latest happenings and rumblings in the Java/Java EE ecosystem.

<br><b>One (mini) Book</b>
<br>
 I did it. Found some time to write a little more than just a blog post. And the feedback I got was pretty amazing.

Just register, benefit from all the free content available there and get a great overview about how DevOps, Microservices, Containers and PaaS influence the way we design and developer applications tomorrow. If you don't have time for the complete book, register and re-watch the accompanying <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2015/12/java-ee-microservices-architecture.html" target="_blank">O'Reilly webcast</a>.
