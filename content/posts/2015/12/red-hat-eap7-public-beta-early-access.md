</div> A little over a month after we made the <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2015/11/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-7.0-alpha.html" target="_blank">alpha version available</a>, the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7 Beta - Early Access was released last Friday.
<br>
<br>
 For a complete list of new features, refer to my <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2015/11/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform-7.0-alpha.html" target="_blank">older blog-post</a> and the <a href="" target="_blank">official release-notes</a>.
<br>
 JBoss EAP 7 &nbsp;is a significant release in every respect; the last major EAP release (EAP 6.0) was back in June, 2012 and after 4 minor feature releases and numerous patch releases, EAP 6 is now just 8 months away from entering its <a href="https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes" target="_blank">long-term maintenance phase</a>. While EAP 6 will be fully supported for many years to come – all new development and new features will target EAP 7 and beyond.
<br>
<br>
