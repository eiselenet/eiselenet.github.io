What a great end to the week. JBoss EAP 6.4 was released and among a<a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.4/html/6.4.0_Release_Notes/sect-New_Features_Enhancements_and_Tech_Previews.html" target="_blank"> ton of technical enhancements and new features</a>, the biggest is: Java 8 has been added to the list of supported configurations. And this includes the Oracle JDK and IBM JDK.
<br>
<br><b>Java SE 7 End of Public Updates Notice</b>
<br>
 After April 2015, Oracle will no longer post updates of Java SE 7 to its public download sites. Existing Java SE 7 downloads already posted as of April 2015 will remain accessible in the Java Archive on the Oracle Technology Network. Developers and end-users are encouraged to update to more recent Java SE versions that remain available for public download in order to continue receiving public updates and security enhancements. This means, that&nbsp;Java 7u79 and 7u80 are the last public releases of Java 7. So, I guess, that we're just in time with Java 8 support.
<br>
 And please keep in mind, that this is a supported update of the Java SE version. The Java EE implementation version still sticks with Java EE 6!

</div><b>WildFly vs. EAP - A Symbiotic Relationship</b>
<br>
 The so called upstream community project <a href="" target="_blank">WildFly</a> is the basis for the commercial (yet open source) <a href="" target="_blank">JBoss Enterprise Application Platform product</a>. While WildFly continuous to embark on the Java EE journey implementing the latest and greatest iteration of the spec, introduce a host of great new features or strive for even better performance. The mission for EAP is long term, strategic and JBoss EAP follows up with a clear focus on enterprise level performance and stability, long term maintenance and first class professional support.
<br>
<br>
 To <a href="" target="_blank">download JBoss EAP as a developer</a> you must have <a href="https://community.jboss.org/register.jspa" target="_blank">a JBoss.org account</a>. You also need to accept the terms and conditions of the JBoss Developer Program which provides $0 subscriptions for development use only. <a href="http://www.jboss.org/faq" target="_blank">Read more about the JBoss Developer Program</a>.
