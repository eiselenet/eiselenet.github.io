</div> I had the pleasure to be invited to the <a href="" target="_blank">virtual JUG</a> yesterday. It is a big honor for many reasons: First of all, I am part of the vJUG board and second because it was my second time presenting to this great group of Java interested people. It is always a pleasure to be invited back.

<br><b>Architecting Large Enterprise Java Projects</b>
<br>
 In the past I’ve been building component oriented applications with what I had at hand. Mostly driven by the features available in the Java EE standard to be “portable” and easy to use. Looking back this has been a perfect fit for many customers and applications. With an increasing demand for highly integrated applications which use already available services and processes from all over the place (departmental, central or even cloud services) this approach starts to feel more and more outdated. And this feel does not come from a technology perspective but from all the requirements around it. Having this in mind this presentation is the starting point of a series of how-to’s and short tutorials which aim to showcase some more diverse ways of building (Java EE) applications that fit better into today’s requirements and landscapes.
