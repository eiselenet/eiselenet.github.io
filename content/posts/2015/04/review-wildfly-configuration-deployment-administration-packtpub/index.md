Travelling has downsides. Especially when coming back to the office to catch up with all the tasks being actively postponed. One of them has been sitting here for too long: It took me a while to get this latest review for Packt Publishing out the door. But this is the good side of traveling, you have plenty of time to read and educate yourself on topics.

<br><b>Abstract</b>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
 <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/wildfly-configuration-deployment-and-administration-second-edition" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="wildfly-administration.jpg" height="320" width="246"></a>
</div><a href="" target="_blank">WildFly</a> 8 is a modular, lightweight, Java EE-compliant application server. Application deployment and management is simplified with WildFly's centralized and easy-to-use administration interface. It supports high availability and latest web technologies, such as web sockets and a non-blocking API. There was previously a lack of a system-administration-free platform that allowed the scaling of Java EE applications, but WildFly 8 in combination with OpenShift fills that gap.
<br>
 The book starts with an explanation of the installation of WildFly and application server configuration. Then, it moves on to the configuration of enterprise services and also explores the new web container Undertow. It then covers domain configuration, application deployment, and application server management. By the end of the book, you will have a firm grasp of all the important aspects of clustering, load balancing, and WildFly security. This guide is invaluable for anyone who works with or is planning to switch to WildFly.

 <b>The Content</b>
</div>
<div>
 353 net pages without intro and appendix is a good deal for this book. Eleven chapters cover nearly every aspect of WildFly. This includes basics, like installation and goes all the way to cloud computing with WildFly on <a href="" target="_blank">OpenShift</a>. The separate chapter on securing WildFly is my personal highlight here. The book was build on top of WildFly version 8.x which fully supports Java EE 7 development on top of Java SE 7.

 <b>Writing and Style</b>
</div>
<div>
 <div>
  Generally the instructions are clear and the many screen-shots are helpful. The overall level of detail and mixed in complexity is appropriate and in case you need it you can download the source code from Packt. I like the clear English writing which identifies the author as a native speaker. I would have wished for more command line examples and a little less XML snippets. The conceptual pictures in the book could be a bit clearer and bigger. But this is pretty much everything I have to criticize.&nbsp;

  <b>Conclusion and recommendation</b>
 </div>
</div>
<div>
 If you are looking for a most complete introduction and you're tired about trying to find the bits and pieces in the online documentation, this book is for you. Also, if you are the kind of person which needs examples and screenshots this book is for you. The very appealing writing style helps in getting all the points across. The unique selling point obviously is the end-to-end coverage of all related topics in a detailed enough way to let you experience WildFly installed locally and on OpenShift.
