</div> Developer Interview time again. Not a Friday, but it was recorded on one. And because it is so awesome, I decided to push it out as soon as I can. Fellow <a href="" target="_blank">Arquillian </a>contributor Alex Soto (<a href="https://twitter.com/alexsotob" target="_blank">@alexsotob</a>) found some time to briefly walk us through what Arquillian is, and how it works and deep dives into the new extension called <a href="" target="_blank">Cube</a>&nbsp;which is an extension that can be used to manager Docker containers from Arquillian. With this extension you can start a Docker container with a server installed, deploy the required deployable file within it and execute Arquillian tests. The key point here is that if Docker is used as deployable platform in production, your tests are executed in a the same container as it will be in production, so your tests are even more real than before.
