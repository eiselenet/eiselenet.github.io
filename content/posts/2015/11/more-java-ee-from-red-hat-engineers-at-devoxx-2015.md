</div> It is <a href="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Devoxx Belgium</a> time! Finally. Everything kicks off today with the University Sessions and the conference itself starts tomorrow morning. We're all pretty excited, as this is the major event in Europe. And Red Hat is proud to be a sponsor again this year. We will be onsite with 14 sessions, a booth - with beer, books and more. Visit the Red Hat booth to see OpenShift by Red Hat in action, <a href="" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">join the new Red Hat Developers program</a>, get your complimentary copy of my new book - <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2015/10/my-book-modern-java-ee-design-patterns.html" target="_blank">Modern JavaEE Design Patterns</a> (while supplies last), and learn how you can get involved with Red Hat. <b>Did I mention we will have free beer on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday at 17:00?</b>
<br>
 Meet our engineers and talk to us about our products or community projects.

 One thing I want to highlight in particular are the Java EE sessions and activities by our engineers. We will have five sessions about Java EE and OpenShift (including Docker and Kubernetes) and I highly encourage you to also look at all the other Java EE related activities which have been <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/entry/java_ee_devoxx_belgium" target="_blank">posted on the Aquarium Blog</a>.

Expert group already added interesting features like asynchronous events or Java SE bootstrap.
