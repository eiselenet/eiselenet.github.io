</div> It's been a short but intense trip. I was invited to speak at the annual <a href="" target="_blank">DevConf.CZ</a> which happened in Brno, Czech Republic last week.&nbsp;Spanning 3 days, DevConf.cz brings together around 1000 developers, quality engineers, administrators, and users from the Fedora, JBoss, and Red Hat communities. With almost 100 talks and workshops spread over 6 different tracks, DevConf.cz is one of the largest events celebrating free software in the region.
<br>
 After the keynote by Tim Burke and Mark Little, the attendees had to pick the best from a very wide-spread schedule with many great topics. The fact, that Red Hat has a large office in Brno gives plenty of opportunity to talk to engineers which you normally wouldn't meet in that compilation elsewhere.
