JayDay 2013 in Munich is an Event for Java-Developers featuring internationally renowned Experts. What started out as a nice little event got even bigger this year. It is still a one day conference but the <a href="" target="_blank">speaker line-up is incredible</a>. I am honored to be part of that list again and I am looking forward meeting many of you there.
<br>
 This year I will talk about "Alien Driven Development". Which basically is a short introduction into Arquillian and the complete eco-system around it.
<br>
<br>
 The JayDay conference will be held on Monday, July 1st 2013. Registration starts at 8:30 am. The official program will start at 9:00 am. The final program isn't published by now. Keep an eye on the <a href="" target="_blank">relevant website</a>.
