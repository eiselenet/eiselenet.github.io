Another conference appearance has been booked for me. I will be speaking at the German Oracle User Group, more precisely at the <a href="" target="_blank">Infrastructure and Middleware Community Summit</a> in Mainz in June. This is all about Oracle Infrastructure and Middleware topics and has a great Speaker lineup for the German Oracle sphere. <a href="http://www.doag.org/de/events/konferenzen/doag-2013-imc-summit/das-programm/keynote.html" target="_blank">Matthias Marschall will present a Keynote on DevOps</a> and the one day event will have <a href="http://www.doag.org/konferenz/Streams.php?id=450672" target="_blank">plenty of content</a> in basically two separate tracks for everybody. 
<br>
<br>
 I'm giving a two hour <a href="http://www.doag.org/de/events/konferenzen/doag-2013-imc-summit/das-programm/lab-track.html" target="_blank">Hands on Lab about JAX-RS and Server Send Events</a> with GlassFish server. There is still time to <a href="https://www.doag.org/termine/anmeldung.php?tid=450672" target="_blank">register for both the Summit</a> and the lab.
<br>
 Looking forward meeting you there!
