Jumping around with Java EE development I naturally get the chance to review books in this area. And I really appreciate the chance to do this. Not only to get a chance to possibly learn something new but also to give the best possible guidance on new releases for my readers. Today it is time for another Packt book review. Published back in December 2012 this is a fresh new take on latest Java EE together with Eclipse.

</div> Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) 6 is the industry standard for enterprise Java computing. Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers is the most commonly used Java IDE for Java EE development. Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers supports Java EE 5 completely and also supports several features from Java EE 6. The Oracle WebLogic Server product line is the industry's most comprehensive platform for developing, deploying, and integrating enterprise applications. Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse provides a set of plugins (project facets) for Eclipse development with WebLogic Server. While a number of books are available on Eclipse IDE for Java Developers, none or very few are available on Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers. In this book, we shall discuss Java EE development in Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers. While it is not feasible to cover all of the more than 30 technologies in the Java EE stack , we shall discuss the most commonly used Java EE technologies, especially the ones Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers (or Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse) provides Project for Facets. Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse is just an enhancement of Eclipse IDE for Java EE developers with integrated support for Oracle WebLogic Server.

<br>
<br><b>The Content</b>
<br>
 If you remove preface and index you end up with 400 pages in 10 chapters. That is reasonable. I'm not digging into every chapter more detailed (see my conclusion for the details)
<br>
<br>
 Chapter Outline:
<br>
 Chapter 1: EJB 3.0 Database Persistence
<br>
 Chapter 2: O/X Mapping with JAXB 2.x
<br>
 Chapter 3: Developing a Web Project for JasperReports
<br>
 Chapter 4: Creating a JSF Data Table
<br>
 Chapter 5: Templating with Facelets
<br>
 Chapter 6: Creating Apache Trinidad User Interfaces
<br>
 Chapter 7: Creating an AJAX Application
<br>
 Chapter 8: Creating a JAX-WS Web Service
<br>
 Chapter 9: RESTful Web Services Using the JAX-RS API
<br>
 Chapter 10: Spring
<br>
<br><b>Writing and Style</b>
<br>
 Generally the instructions are clear and the screen-shots are helpful. The overall level of detail and mixed in complexity is appropriate and in case you need it you can download the source code from Packt. 
<br>
<br><b>Conclusion and recommendation</b>
<br>
 The book is aimed at intermediate to advanced Java EE developers. With Eclipse at version 3.7 (and Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse), Ant and manual dependency management on top of Java SE 5 it is outdated today. Even if it uses Oracle's WebLogic 12c as server for the examples (which would be Java EE 6 capable) and some Java EE 6 technologies (e.g. JSF2) this is a mixture between the worlds and not very helpful for beginners. The topics and chapters look weird and it is hard to understand the concept behind it if you only look on them. A decent introduction to the overall plot would have been helpful. Bottom line: You get a decent overview about Java EE with Eclipse but the details are outdated and no longer appropriate to learn. Further on, the selection and mixture in technologies (Java EE 5/6, Spring, Jasper, Trinidad) makes it very hard to separate the standard from the add-ons, which is a no-go for me.
