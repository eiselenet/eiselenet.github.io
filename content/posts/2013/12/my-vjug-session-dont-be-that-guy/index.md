I've been invited to talk at the <a href="" target="_blank">vJUG</a> which is the newest JUG around. A virtual JUG reaching out to interested Java Developers over all time zones and locations. The &nbsp;aim is to get the greatest minds and speakers of the Java industry giving talks and presentations for this community, in the form of webinars and JUG session streaming from JUG f2f meetups.

<br>
 Was a session already scheduled for JavaOne this year. Due to scheduling conflicts I actually had to cancel it and I was pretty excited to finally be able to deliver it to the many who signed up for the session in SF. <a href="" target="_blank">With 174 registered attendees</a> I count this as a success.
<br>
<br>
 The session was given via Google Hangout (Thanks Google!) and recorded to Youtube for you to re-watch.
