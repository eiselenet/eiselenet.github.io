... and it is time to sit back and relax a bit. It has been exhausting for me on many levels and I tried not to leave any opportunity slip through. It is time to say thanks. I'm thankful for the many people seeing me sessions on conferences around the world. Thankful for the readers on this blog, for the feedback I receive on Twitter or even in person. Thankful for a steadily growing and strong Java community and even thankful for Oracle taking the steward job serious and not having burnt too many bridges this year.
<br>
<br>
 There are plenty of things upcoming next year. All starts with the IOUC meeting in January, a great <a href="" target="_blank">Jfokus </a>conference in Stockholm in February, the <a href="" target="_blank">JavaLand </a>conference in March followed by the <a href="http://www.ougn.no/ougn-vrseminar-2014" target="_blank">OUGN&nbsp;Vårseminar</a> and the newly created <a href="" target="_blank">DevNation </a>conference in April. There are plenty of opportunities to meet and talk. I'm looking forward to this new year. And some silent days.
<br>
 Wishing you a prosperous and happy new year

 “We will open the book.
 <br>
 Its pages are blank.
 <br>
 We are going to put words on them ourselves.

 The book is called Opportunity

 and its first chapter is New Year's Day.”
