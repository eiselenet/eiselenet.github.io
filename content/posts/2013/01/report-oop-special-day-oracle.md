Once a year famous <a href="" target="_blank">OOP conference</a> is happening&nbsp;literally&nbsp;next to where I live. A 20 minutes ride brings me down to Munich's trade fair center and the biggest hassle I have to cope with is parking. As usual I forget to submit a talk and I was lucky to be invited by Oracle to speak at the <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/emeapartnerweblogic/entry/oracle_developer_day_oop_2013" target="_blank">Oracle Special Day</a>.
<br>

</div> For many years, OOP has become the meeting point for technical experts (architects, developers, requirements-engineers, testers, etc.), technical (project) managers and leaders in IT, because the conference allows gaining an excellent overview of the state-of-the-art in modern software engineering.
<br>
 So, it is always worth to get a full conference ticket but in case you cant, the special days are a nice alternative. They are a free for pre registered attendees and run the whole day. If you like its kind of a conference within the conference.
<br>
 The Oracle Special Day was&nbsp;divided&nbsp;into three big areas. It began with a short update on the roadmap of the Java and Oracle universe (including JavaFX and ADF Mobile). Directly followed by a Java EE part where I introduced and showcased the Java Cloud Service and Adam Bien did a nice Java EE 6 introduction.

<br>
 The last part was dedicated to three Hands-On-Labs where interested attendees could get a first impression on either JavaFX, ADF Mobile or Java EE 6 with GlassFish. With roughly 80 attendees this was quite a&nbsp;successful&nbsp;day and it was a pleasure to talk in my first language on a conference :)
