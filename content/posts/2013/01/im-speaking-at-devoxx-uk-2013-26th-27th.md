Here we go! I'm excited to speak at first ever <a href="" target="_blank">Devoxx UK</a> this year! After the tremendous success of the flagship in Belgium and the French spin-off this is the second Devoxx offspring. Hosted by Ben and Martijn and held at the Business Design Center in London, UK.
<br>
 The Business Design Center is a beautiful former agricultural hall from Victorian days. It's situated only one stop away from Kings Cross/St Pancras (Eurostar terminal in the heart of London) and is on a street famed for its pubs, cafes and restaurants - nom nom! The venue is fully wheelchair accessible and we'll have it decked out in full Devoxx regalia. You can find more details on the <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/The+Venue" target="_blank">Devoxx UK venue page</a>. 
<br>
 Devoxx is renowned for bringing in the who's who of the Java and Software Development worlds as well as showcasing talent from the local development community. Devoxx UK is no different! A couple of <a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/UK13/Speakers" target="_blank">Rockstar speakers</a> have already confirmed! 
<br>
<br>
 I'm talking about the:
<br><b>Seven Deadly Sins</b>
<br>
 Have you ever wondered what the worst mistakes in your Java EE projects could be? Lets call them the seven deadly sins and walk through them and save you and your projects from eternal damnation.
<br>
<br>
 Don't forget to&nbsp;<a href="https://reguk.devoxx.com/public#UK13" target="_blank">organize&nbsp;the two days off on the 26th and 27th of March</a> to join the <a href="" target="_blank">London Java Community</a> and the merry Knights of <a href="" target="_blank">Devoxx UK</a> at the Business Design Center in London, UK. For further updates follow <a href="" target="_blank">@DevoxxUK</a>. I'm very looking forward meeting you there!
