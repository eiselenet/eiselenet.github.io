I usually don't do marketing on this blog. This is a little exception as I am an active German Oracle User Group (DOAG) Member and also their representative on the German Interest Alliance of the Java User Groups (iJUG) and I have some discount to offer, so I guess it will be worth reading on if you're interested in Java EE 7 and Java Server Faces especially. Here is the deal:
<br>
<br><b>JSF Spec Lead Ed Burns is coming to Germany for an exclusive training!</b>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
 <a href="http://www.doag.org/termine/termine.php?tid=459635" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="320" src="IMG-20121002-00574.jpg" width="239"></a>
</div> The course provides an in-depth survey of JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.2, the standard Web application framework for Java EE. The course assumes no familiarity with JSF, but the material covering the new features of JSF 2.2 is used for the second half of the course. Typical JSF gotchas will also be covered in context.
<br>
<br>
 Because JSF is a technology that unifies several other layers of the Java EE stack, the course approaches JSF from three distinct but related viewpoints: the application developer, the UI component developer, and the framework extender.
<br>
<br>
 Two days packed with Java EE 7 UI technology including NetBeans coding. And you don't have to bring a lot of things. Only Java programming and web framework experience is a prerequisite.
<br>
<br>
 The training will happen right next to JavaZone on the <b>10.09.2013 and 11.09.2013</b> at the DOAG headquarters in <b>Berlin</b>.
<br>
<br>
