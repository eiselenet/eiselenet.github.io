This blog has its fans and I am very thankful for them. But one little drawback always has been that I blog in English. And I like it the way it is. But as a German there is always the need to spread the word out to the German Java Community.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

</div> And in order to do this in my native language the idea was born to actually run a German blog. Naughty, isn't it? :) It probably wouldn't be an option to simply setup a translated version of this blog. Nobody would want that. Especially not me. But German publishing house Heise was so kind to offer me <a href="http://www.heise.de/developer/neuigkeiten-von-der-insel-1920360.html" target="_blank">a nice place on their developer website</a>. This is where I will be blogging about news from the Island of Java. In German. It will be a mix of technical and non-technical topics. Mostly like I try to do it here. So if you're interested in reading about my rumblings with Java and the latest news from the community in German: Head over there and please don't forget to give feedback. I love to hear about what you want to read.
