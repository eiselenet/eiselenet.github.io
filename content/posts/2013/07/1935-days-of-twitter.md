Today I finally managed to download my Twitter archive. This nice new features was introduces a while back already but I never really cared about it. But looking back at 5 years, 3 months, 17 days is like doing forensics. And it is good to look back in time to remember what you did. Here is a high level overview about my twitter content since than as a nice little <a href="http://www.wordle.net/create" target="_blank">wordle art</a>. I love it. Thanks for reading both my twitter stream and this blog. Looking forward to the next years to come.
