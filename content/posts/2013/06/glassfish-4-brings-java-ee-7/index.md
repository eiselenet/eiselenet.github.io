What a surprise. Apple had nothing to offer at&nbsp;wwdc except the new iOS 7 launch. Might be coincidence that shortly after their keynote another 7 made an official appearance. GlassFish 4.0 was release yesterday evening (obviously unwanted). The new Java EE 7 reference implementation automatically is the first Java EE 7 application server available today.

<br><b>New Website&nbsp;</b>

</div> After 89 promoted builds (first from&nbsp;14-Sep-2011) it took the team&nbsp;1 year, 8 months and 1 day to get the new release ready. Congratulations to the release. Everything seems to point to the fact, that it should have been released for the June 12 launch event. Some links on the completely reworked website didn't work yesterday and the <a href="https://glassfish.java.net/ide.html" target="_blank">NetBeans 7.3.1</a> release which finally supports Java EE 7 isn't available as of today. The commercial offering which is called "Oracle GlassFish Server" also didn't seem to have hit it's <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/glassfish/overview/index.html" target="_blank">place on OTN</a>.

</div> The launch comes with a completely revamped <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/firstcup/doc/home.htm" target="_blank">Java EE 7 Example. The "First Cup"</a> application calculates the age of Duke, the Java mascot and interacts with the users.&nbsp;Duke was born May 23, 1995, when the first demo of Java technology was publicly released. It contains JAX-RS, EJB, JSF and JPA. Find the source and some more information on the <a href="https://java.net/projects/firstcup" target="_blank">java.net project website</a>. The complete code is developed under a BSD license and you're free to play around with it.
