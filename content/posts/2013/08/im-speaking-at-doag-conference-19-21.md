Another conference announcement. The annual conference of the German Oracle User Group DOAG is ready to accept registrations. The speaker confirmations have been send out and I am happy to say that I will be speaking about the Oracle Cloud Java Service on the 19th.
<br>
<br><b>Oracle Cloud Java Service for Java EE Developer</b>
<br>
 19.11.2013, 15:00-15:45, Room 14 (<a href="http://www.doag.org/konferenz/vortrag_details.php?tag=&amp;kid=441438&amp;id=465662" target="_blank">schedule entry</a>)
<br>
 A brief introduction about the two basic services (Java and Database) and an overview about the development tools and online consoles. All brushed up and explained for Java EE devs to make their start into Oracle's cloud offering a breeze.
<br>
<br>
 The <a href="http://www.doag.org/en/events/konferenzen/doag-2013.html" target="_blank">DOAG conference and exhibition</a> features 10 streams with more than 400 sessions and additional activities around all the Oracle ecosystem topics. A <a href="http://www.doag.org/konferenz/2013-konferenzplan.php" target="_blank">complete schedule is online</a> and covers all three days.
<br>
 This years Java Track is in room 20 and features a track keynote by Ed Burns about Portlet 3.0 and JSF 2.2. With 15 Java sessions this for sure isn't a plain Java conference but it was never intended to be one. So you find additional stuff over at the different Oracle technology centered tracks like Development or Middleware &amp; SOA. Most of the sessions will be German but as every year there is a strong international presence of many big names from the Oracle ecosystem.
