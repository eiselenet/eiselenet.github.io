I recently had the pleasure of reviewing “<a href="https://packt.link/MwOta" target="_blank">Java Coding Problems, Second Edition</a>” by Anghel Leonard, and I must say that it’s an excellent resource for Java developers looking to improve their problem-solving skills.&nbsp;

 This book is a comprehensive collection of Java knowledge organised in 13 chapters. It covers pretty much all the major challenges a Java developer comes across when developing modern business applications:&nbsp;

 What I particularly enjoyed about this book was the way it presented each problem in a clear and concise manner. Anghel provided a detailed explanation of the concept behind each exercise, making it easy for readers to grasp the underlying principles. Additionally, the solutions were well-structured and easy to follow, providing a great reference point for those looking to implement their own solutions. One of my favorite aspects of this book was its focus on real-world problems. Anghel has done an excellent job of including scenarios that developers will encounter in their daily work, making it a valuable resource for anyone looking to improve their Java skills. In terms of the writing style, I found Anghel’s approach to be clear and concise, with a touch of humor. He presents complex concepts in a way that’s easy to understand, making it an enjoyable read for both beginners and experienced developers. The way the book is structured makes it enjoyable both as a learning resource but also as a problem encyclopedia. Overall, I highly recommend “Java Coding Problems, Second Edition” to anyone looking to improve their Java skills or looking for a resource to help them prepare for coding challenges. It’s a well-structured book that provides a comprehensive set of practical exercises, along with clear explanations and solutions.
