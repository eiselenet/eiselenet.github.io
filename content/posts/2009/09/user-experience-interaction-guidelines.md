 The Windows product team released the official <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511258.aspx" target="_blank">Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines as PDF</a>.
<br>
<br>
 The goals for these official Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines (or "UX Guide" for short) are to:
<br>
 - Establish a high quality and consistency baseline for all Windows-based applications.
<br>
 - Answer specific user experience questions.

 Even if the guidelines focus on Windows, they are worth a click. As most of you already came across some user demands like "have it like in the explorer ..." ... it could be worth thinking about the basic design principles behind on of the most popular operating systems.
