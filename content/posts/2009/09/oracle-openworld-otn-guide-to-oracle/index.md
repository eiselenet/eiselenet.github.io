Just today Oracle published the <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/2009/08/just_published_the_otn_guide_t.html" target="_blank">OTN Guide to Oracle OpenWorld 2009</a>, a quick summary of all the goodies you can look forward to in October (something like 60 days away - wow).

My flights are booked, and I am quite excited about visiting SF :) Hope, to be able to blog and tweet a lot during the OOW.
