This is a special date this year. Not only that it's my birthday where I get ((58647 - 45678 + 4758 - 324 + 589) * 0,54) - 715,68 - 8967) years old.

 It is about the elections to the Bundestag in Germany. I have never been too much into politics. My main interest always was about environmental protection 
<br>
 and a safe place to life. Both grew again since I am a father :) This year another topic appeared on the map. It is all about freedom. 
<br>
 Freedom to protect what is called privacy. Freedom to access information and to restrict copyright laws to a practical level.
