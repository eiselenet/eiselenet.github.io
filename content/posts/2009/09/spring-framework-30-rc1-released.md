<a href="" target="_blank">Juergen Hoeller</a> <a href="" target="_blank">announced the availability</a> of the newest Spring Framework 3.0 RC1 release.
<br>
<br>
 This release completes the key Spring 3.0 feature set. Beginning with the original themes REST and EL the feature list have been expanded significantly:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>Fully Java 5 based</li>
 <li>Spring expression language (SpEL)</li>
 <li>Extended support for annotation-based components</li>
 <li>Powerful stereotype model</li>
 <li>Standardized dependency injection annotations</li>
 <li>Declarative model validation based on constraint annotations</li>
 <li>Enhanced binding and formatting facilities</li>
 <li>Comprehensive REST support</li>
 <li>Object/XML Mapping (OXM)</li>
 <li>Portlet 2.0 support</li>
 <li>Next-generation scheduling capabilities</li>
 <li>Early support for Java EE 6</li>
</ul>
<br>
 More words on the JEE6 support. Spring 3.0 already supports the use of JSF 2.0 and JPA 2.0 in a Spring environment, in addition to JSR-303 and JSR-330 support. Further Java EE 6 related specifications such as Servlet 3.0 will be fully supported as they become available in concrete products; this is scheduled for the Spring 3.1/3.2 timeframe.
