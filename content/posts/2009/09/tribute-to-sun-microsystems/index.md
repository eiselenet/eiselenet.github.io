For more than 27 years, Sun has led the way in network computing innovation. And while oftentimes taking the road less traveled, the journey has delivered some of the most revolutionary — and evolutionary — ideas, business practices, and products. From Solaris to Java, open standards to open source, high-performance computing to eco computing, and everything in between, they have created a vibrant culture and a rich history. This was shared with partners, developers, students, universities, and of course customers.
