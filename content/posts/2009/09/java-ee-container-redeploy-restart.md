<a href="" target="_blank">The Java EE Container Redeploy &amp; Restart Report</a> comes from a survey with over 1100 Java EE developer respondents. It analyzes time spent on the Redeploy and Restart process, and compares the following containers: 
<br>
<br>
<ul>
 <li>GlassFish</li>
 <li>Jetty</li>
 <li>Tomcat</li>
 <li>WebSphere</li>
 <li>WebLogic</li>
</ul>Among other results, this report shows that Java EE developers are spending three to seven work weeks a year on redeploys and restarts, depending on their container of choice.

<blockquote>
 There are few surprises here. Jetty is leading the pack with only 5.8 minutes per hour spent redeploying and IBM WebSphere is trailing with more than twice more — 13.8 minutes per hour. One thing to note is that although Jetty startup is undoubtedly faster than IBM WebSphere it is likely that most of the difference is due to the size of the applications deployed and the technologies used in them.
