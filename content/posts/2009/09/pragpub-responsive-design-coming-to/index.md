The Issue 3, September 2009 contains an interesting article by by Kent Beck about "Responsive Design: Coming to Grips with the Chaos That Is Software Design". 
<br>
Beside the fact, that we both seem to share the same BASICs :), Kent made some statements I fully comply with.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 Design is good. Design is central to effective software development.
 <br>
 Programmers can add features steadily to well-designed software. Programmers
 <br>
 can easily test well-designed software. Well-designed software is easy to tune
 <br>
 for better performance. Most of the hard problems in programming turn out
 <br>
 to be design problems.
 <br>
 But design has a dark side. While there isn’t a single best design for any system,
 <br>
 there are many poor designs for that same system. The more experience a
 <br>
 programmer has, the more design ideas he knows.
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 The word "responsive" in the name of the project reflects this need for balance.
 <br>
 Some design needs to be done in advance of coding, but over the life of the
 <br>
 project most design will be done in response to the changing needs of the
 <br>
 system and the changing and growing understanding of the developers.
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
He provides a brief overview of the lessions he has learned so far:
<br>
1) Beneficially Relating Elements.
<br>
2) Design is Fractal.
<br>
3) Safe Steps.
<br>
4) Isolate Changes.
<br>
5) Embrace Ambiguity.
<br>
6) Cultivate Confidence.
<br>
7) Cultivate Humility.
<br>
8) Exploit Symmetries.
<br>
9) Trust Succession.
<br>
10) Design Is a Team Sport.
<br>
11) Play with Words.
<br>
12) Play with Pictures.
<br>
13) Clear Strategies.
<br>
14) Inside or Outside.
<br>
15) Toss It.
<br>
16) Keep It.
<br>
17) Both.
<br>
18) Suit Design to Needs.
<br>
19) Use Tension.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 Design is not a rational process.
 <br>
 Much as we like to think we are making design decisions, much of the structure
 <br>
 of our systems emerges from the nature of the problem and the nature of the
 <br>
 tools we use. Our designs shape us as much as we shape our designs.
 <br>
 [...]
 <br>
 The challenge is to embrace responsibility
 <br>
 and at the same time take an appropriate role in designing. Learning to achieve
 <br>
 this balance is the next goal of the Responsive Design Project.
