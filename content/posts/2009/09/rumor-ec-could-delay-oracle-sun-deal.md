<a href="" target="_blank">Reuters reports on rumors on Oracle/Sun/EU.</a>

<blockquote>
 <br>
 The commission antitrust authority is debating whether to approve the deal by Thursday's deadline, amid concern about Oracle getting its hands on Sun's MySQL database, the sources told Reuters.

 <br>
 BTW, the value of the acquisition is not primarily in the technology Oracle is getting, but rather in the people that come along with it. These are world-class, talented and innovative engineers, product managers, etc., who understand the OSS space really, really well. I hope Oracle listens to them, carefully, and take their message to heart. It will be good for all involved.
