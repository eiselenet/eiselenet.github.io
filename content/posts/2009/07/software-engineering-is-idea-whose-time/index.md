Have you read the recent <a href="http://www2.computer.org/cms/Computer.org/ComputingNow/homepage/2009/0709/rW_SO_Viewpoints.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE-Article from Tom DeMarco (PDF)</a>?
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 My early metrics book, Controlling
 <br>
 Software Projects: Management,
 <br>
 Measurement, and
 <br>
 Estimation (Prentice Hall/Yourdon
 <br>
 Press, 1982), played a role
 <br>
 in the way many budding software
 <br>
 engineers quantified work
 <br>
 and planned their projects. In
 <br>
 my reflective mood, I’m wondering,
 <br>
 was its advice correct at the
 <br>
 time, is it still relevant, and do I
 <br>
 still believe that metrics are a must for any successful
 <br>
 software development effort? My answers
 <br>
 are no, no, and no.
 <br>
 <br>
 [...]
 <br>
 <br>
 I'm gradually coming to the conclusion that software engineering is an idea whose time has come and gone.
 <br>
 <br>
 [...]
 <br>
 <br>
 Software development is and always will be somewhat experimental. The actual software construction isn't necessarily experimental, but its conception is. And this is where our focus ought to be. It's where our focus always ought to have been.

Dont forget to read the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001288.html" target="_blank">interpretation from Jeff Atwood</a>.
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 What DeMarco seems to be saying -- and, at least, what I am definitely saying -- is that control is ultimately illusory on software development projects. If you want to move your project forward, the only reliable way to do that is to cultivate a deep sense of software craftsmanship and professionalism around it.

What nearly anybody seems to know. This articel is not too new. Find a german version published in the <a href="http://www.sigs.de/publications/os/2008/06/interview_DeMarco_OS_06_08.pdf" target="_blank">ObjektSpektrum 08/2006 here</a>.

What I love most in this discussion is a quote from Tom DeMarco:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 “Software development is and always will be somewhat experimental.” (DeMarco)
