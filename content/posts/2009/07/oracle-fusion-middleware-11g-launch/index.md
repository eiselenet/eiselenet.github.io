Yesterday I attended the Oracle Fusion Middleware 11g Launch in Munich. It was a small but very interesting event at all. Alex Andrianopoulos (Vice President, Oracle Fusion Middleware Product Marketing) and John Aisien (Vice President of Product Management,
<br>
Oracle Fusion Middleware, EMEA Oracle Corporation) gave a longer and more detailed overview about the new features of OFM 11g. After the break their track was followed by a couple of more deeper presentation about special topics.

<br>
What was most interesting at all from a weblogic point of view?
<br>
<ul>
 <br>
 <li>Within 11g all bea products are finaly integrated into the whole middleware stack.</li>
 <br>
 <li>The Weblogic Server is now available as 10.3.1.0 - a minor relase at all</li>
 <br>
 <li>You now have forms and reports integration in WLS</li>
 <br>
 <li>JRockit is available as jrockit_160_05_R27.6.2-20</li>
 <br>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
You can download the new 11g release from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/middleware/index.html" target="_blank">oracle technology network (otn)</a>. The basic weblogic server download now comes with the latest Oracle Enterprise Pack for Eclipse (OEPE). But you can still download it without. Give it a try.
