According the the <a href="" target="_blank">Oracle ArchBeat Blog</a>, the entire OTN Arch2Arch Podcast interview with Oracle’s Bill Dettelback is now available. In this interview Bill discusses Oracle Application Grid as an architectural concept, describes some of the similarities and differences between Application Grid and other architectural approaches, talks about the roles Weblogic Server, Coherence, Enterprise Manager, Tuxedo, and JRockit play within the Application Grid architecture, and then wraps it all up by talking about what it all means for architects.
