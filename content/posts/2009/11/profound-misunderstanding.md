The European Commission has issued its formal "statement of objections" over Oracle's planned acquisition of Sun Microsystems, Sun said in a regulatory filing Monday.
<br>
 Up to now, this statement was not published anywhere and is only available from Sun written in a letter to the SEC.
<br>
<br>
 Oracle published <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/039824" target="_blank">a statement to</a> this yesterday.
<br>

<blockquote>
 The Commission's Statement of Objections reveals a profound misunderstanding of both database competition and open source dynamics.
