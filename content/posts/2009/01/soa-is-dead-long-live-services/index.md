Now it is official :) The burton group analyst Anne Thomas Manes anounces on her blog, what everybody already knew ;) <b>SOA is Dead!</b>
<br>
<br>
My favorite quote:
<br>
<br><i>It’s time to accept reality. SOA fatigue has turned into SOA disillusionment.</i>
<br>
<br><i><br>
 SOA met its demise on January 1, 2009, when it was wiped out by the catastrophic impact of the economic recession. SOA is survived by its offspring: mashups, BPM, SaaS, Cloud Computing, and all other architectural approaches that depend on “services”.<br></i>

Btw: If you like to, you can have a look at<a href="http://www.eisele.net/pdf/me07.pdf" target="_blank"> my SOA Paper (PDF, ~1.4MB)</a>. It was written in 2006. Quite surprising, what we wrote there before :) Sorry for all english speakers. It is only available in german.

<br><b>[UPDATE:]</b>
<br>
After the tremendous amount of reactions regarding the post the author added another blogpost which states a bit more clearly what she was adressing:

 <br>
 My real point is that we should not be talking about an architectural concept that has no universally accepted definition and an indefensible value proposition. Instead we should be talking about concrete things (like services) and concrete architectural practices (like application portfolio management) that deliver real value to the business.
