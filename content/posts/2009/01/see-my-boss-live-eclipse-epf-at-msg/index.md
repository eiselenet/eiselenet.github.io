My department chief <a href="https://www.xing.com/profile/Rainer_Singvogel" target="_blank">Rainer Singvogel</a> is going to give a speech at the <a href="" target="_blank">SE 2009</a> in march. His speech has the title <a href="http://www.se2009.de/industrietag/index.html#0339b59b94079cb0e" target="_blank">"Effective and efficient: Software development processes based on Eclipse EPF"</a>.
<br>
He is going to talk about msg's own software development process and how we based it on the EPF framework. I have not seen the slides up to now, but I expect some more details on general best practices and basic usage of the most common EPF features to allow for needed flexibility.
