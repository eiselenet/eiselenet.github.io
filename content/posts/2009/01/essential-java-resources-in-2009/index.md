I personaly like the section about "Future trends to watch".
<br>
<ul>
 <br>
 <li>Dynamic languages</li>
 <br>
 <li>Functional languages</li>
 <br>
 <li>Closures in Java</li>
 <br>
 <li>The DaVinci Machine</li>
 <br>
 <li>User interface developments</li>
 <br>
</ul>

<blockquote>
 <br>
 As with anything "futures"-related, keep in mind that what's being discussed today may turn out to be a wrong direction, a flash-in-the-pan, a momentary distraction, an influence on the industry, or the Next Big Thing; keep an open mind and a healthy sense of skepticism in equal doses.
