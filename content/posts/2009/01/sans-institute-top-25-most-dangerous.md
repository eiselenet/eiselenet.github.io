On January 12, 2009 the SANS Institute released a combined list of the <a href="" target="_blank">25 most dangerous programming errors</a>. Experts from more than 30 US and international cyber security organizations jointly released the consensus list.
<br>
<br>
The 2009 CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Programming Errors is a list of the most significant programming errors that can lead to serious software vulnerabilities. They occur frequently, are often easy to find, and easy to exploit. They are dangerous because they will frequently allow attackers to completely take over the software, steal data, or prevent the software from working at all. 
<br>
<br>
Until now, most guidance focused on the 'vulnerabilities' that result from programming errors. This is helpful. <a href="" target="_blank">The Top 25</a>, however, focuses on the actual programming errors, made by developers that create the vulnerabilities. As important, <a href="" target="_blank">the Top 25 web site</a> provides detailed and authoritative information on mitigation.
<br>
<br>
The main goal for the Top 25 list is to stop vulnerabilities at the source by educating programmers on how to eliminate all-too-common mistakes before software is even shipped. The list will be a tool for education and awareness that will help programmers to prevent the kinds of vulnerabilities that plague the software industry. Software consumers could use the same list to help them to ask for more secure software. Finally, software managers and CIOs can use the Top 25 list as a measuring stick of progress in their efforts to secure their software.
