Friday morning. In fact it is a bit too early for waking up during my holidays but that is quite normal for me. Befor I jump into the topic of this post I wish you all a wonderfull start into the new year and hope, you had a wonderfull christmas time with your loved ones. 
<br>
<br>
During the more silent times of the year it is more easy to reflect on the things that happened in the past. 2008 was by far the most interesting and challenging year of my life so far. Beginning with the mostly stress-free pregnancy of my wife things changed significant with the birth of our daughter in march. Beside this, I became responsible as a software architect for a new project in my company. Not too bad at all. The unlovely part in this was the fact, that it was anything but small and simple :) Therefore I was more onsite with the customer than I wish I had to. So I missed some of the early proceedings of my daughter.
<br>
But after all, the good things prevailed.
