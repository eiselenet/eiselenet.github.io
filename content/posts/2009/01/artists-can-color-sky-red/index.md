<p class="flickr-yourcomment">Did this recently. It's a true artwork. A combination of two images. One taken with my famous N73 (which I still love, even if I now have to use this cam-sick blackberry) and one taken with my 350D.<br><br>
 The quote posted along with the image:<br><br><i>“Artists can color the sky red because they know it's blue. Those of us who aren't artists must color things the way they really are or people might think we're stupid.”<br>
  (Jules Feiffer)</i></p>
