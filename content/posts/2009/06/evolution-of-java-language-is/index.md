One of my favourite comments on this years JavaOne comes from Cay Horstmann. He is the author of Core Java (Sun Microsystems Press 1996-2004), Enterprise Java for Elvis (Sun Microsystems Press, to appear), and co-author of Core JSF (Sun Microsystems Press 2004)an a professor of computer science at San Jose State University. He is a computer science series editor at Prentice-Hall and a frequent speaker at computer industry conferences. For four years, Cay was VP and CTO of an Internet startup that went from 3 people in a tiny office to a public company.

 The evolution of the Java language is essentially over. There may be a few minor tweaks on the way, but if you are pining for closures, properties, or metaclasses, look elsewhere. Scala is a great choice today, and Groovy could be good if they'd just start writing a language spec. (Cay Horstmann)
