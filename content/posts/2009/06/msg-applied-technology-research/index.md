Some company news. Sorry for that in advance ;) 
<br>
For the last years my whole department almost worked in silence. We were working for our internal customers. Since a few days, this changed slightly. We now have our own part of the <a href="http://www.msg-systems.com/unt_technologiekomp.0.html" target="_blank">msg group website</a> (only german up to now) and this is not only a change on the web but also in our duties. Beside the challenging and satisfying support for the different industries within the msg group, we can now directly support external customers on selected problems, too. So, get in contact with my employer if you are interested. Hope, you enjoy the new department name as much as I do: 
<br><strong>msg Applied Technology Research (XT).</strong>
