Big things ahead. Beginning on the first of July, Oracle starts introducing the new Fusion Middleware 11g. I am excited to see the new Oracle WebLogic Suite 11g and Application Grid. Especially about WebLogic Server, Coherence and JRockit news. There will be a couple of launch events around the globe. On the 2.July there will be one in Munich. Good chance to see Alex Andrianopoulos (Vice President, Oracle Fusion Middleware Product Marketing) and John Aisien (Vice President of Product Management, 
<br>
Oracle Fusion Middleware, EMEA Oracle Corporation).
