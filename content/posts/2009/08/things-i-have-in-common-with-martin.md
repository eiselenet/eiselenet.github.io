Read <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DigitalSLR.html" target="_blank">this post</a> by <a href="http://martinfowler.com" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a> today. He is talking about his hobby photography. As you may know, this is something I love, too. He even owns the same cam and started with nearly the same set of lenses :)

 We geeks like photography because it provides the veneer of an artistic endeavor while allowing us to indulge in lots of technical details and spend money on expensive toys.

After all, it's good to read that even the smartest and hard working people think about their work-live balance and are able to take some realy <a href="" target="_blank">cool and sharp "shots"</a> :)
