Mike Cico wrote a <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/cico-wldf.html" target="_blank">quick tour of your options for gathering server and application performance data</a> from Oracle WebLogic Server which was published on <a href="http://otn.oracle.com" target="_blank">otn.oracle.com</a>.
<br>
The articel focuses on using WLDF to instrument an application and monitor its performance via the WLDF console.
<br>
<br>
In detail it focuses on:
<br>
 * Monitoring for SLA violations
<br>
 * Monitoring CPU load
<br>
 * Graphing method and MBean data
<br>
 * Finding bottleneck methods
<br>
<br>
If you want to start over with the WLDF for the first time, you could also have a first look at the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/pub/articles/dev2arch/2006/06/wldf.html" target="_blank">introductional article by Rebecca Sly</a>.
