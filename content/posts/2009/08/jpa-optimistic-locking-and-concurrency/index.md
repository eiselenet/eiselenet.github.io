The JPA provides a relatively easy way to persist objects, however, there are certain cases that often require a deeper understanding of the consequences that can take place. In two recent posts, <a href="" target="_blank">Carol McDonald</a> and <a href="" target="_blank">Felipe Gaucho</a> walk you through two such cases. Carol McDonald first discusses <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/caroljmcdonald/archive/2009/07/jpa_20_concurre.html" target="_blank">concurrency and locking in the context of the new JPA 2.0 version</a>, while in a second post Felipe Gaucho talks about <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/felipegaucho/archive/2009/08/dont_break_the.html" target="_blank">optimistic locking in the current JPA</a> release and what's in store on this same topic for JPA 2.0
