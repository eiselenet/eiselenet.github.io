I am always on the hunt for new eclipse plugins, that eases development. There is a very (too) short list of them up to now. 
<br>
How about you? Do you have favourite plugins? Which ones?
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
<br>

<br>
The Subversive project aims to provide Subversion (SVN) integration for Eclipse. 
<br>
The Subversive plug-in gives you the ability to work with this CVS successor 
<br>
version control system from the Eclipse workbench. 
<br>
<br>
- Explore FS
<br><a href="">http://www.junginger.biz/eclipse/</a>
<br>
<br>
ExploreFS is a tiny plugin (~6KB) that opens a selected file in the folder of the native file manager. 
<br>
It adds "Explore in File System" to the context menu of Eclipse's package explorer, resource navigator, and other views.
<br>
<br>
- Log4E 
<br><a href="http://log4e.jayefem.de/update">http://log4e.jayefem.de/update</a>
<br>
<br>
Log4E is an Eclipse Plugin which helps you to set up your logger easily in Java Projects. 
<br>
It assists you in several tasks: logger declaration, logger Insertions at certain method entries, 
<br>
substitution of System out's, modification of already existing logger statements.
<br>
Log4E has active support for Log4j, Commons Logging and JDK 1.4 Logging.
