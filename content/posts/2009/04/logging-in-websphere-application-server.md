WebSphere Application Server Community Edition (WAS CE) provides several ways to configure application logging, using java.util.logging, Log4j and SLF4j APIs. Though the steps to configure these logging services are to large extent independent of any application server, WebSphere Application Server requires certain tweaks to get your desired logging behavior.

The <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/websphere/tutorials/0903_madgula/index.html" target="_blank">new tutorial on developerworks</a> from Phani Madgula walks you through these tweaks coupled with sample applications. WebSphere Application Server Community Edition is freely available for download, so you can get started in just a few minutes.
