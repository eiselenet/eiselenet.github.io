There is not much time these days to write blogposts. But this one is needed:
<br>
After the speculations about IBM buying SUN, now it's official: Oracle took over Sun. As announced yesterday this is subject to Sun stockholder approval, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. Oracle is expecting the transaction to close this summer.
<br>
<br>
Taken from the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/sun/sun-faq.pdf" target="_blank">FaQ</a>:
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 Oracle’s ownership of two key Sun software assets, Java and Solaris, is expected to provide our customers with significant benefit. Java is one of the computer industry’s best known brands and most widely deployed technologies. Oracle Fusion Middleware is built on top of Sun’s Java language and software. Oracle can now ensure continued innovation and investment in Java technology for the benefit of customers and the Java community.
