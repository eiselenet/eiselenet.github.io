As <a href="" target="_blank">techcrunch reports</a> yesterday, Google AppEngine, a platform for building and hosting web applications in the cloud, will begin letting developers write applications in Java in the near future. Until now only Python applications were supported. The announcement should come at the Google I/O conference in late May.
<br>
<br>
Java applications are extremely popular, particularly for business applications, and it is one of the internally supported languages at Google. 
<br>

I am excited to see, what happens. As reported in january, <a href="http://www.eisele.net/blog/2009/02/oracle-weblogic-server-on-amazons-ec2.html" target="_blank">Oracle Weblogic Server is already available in Amazon's EC2</a>. Can't wait to see Glassfish (?) in the Google AppEngine :)
