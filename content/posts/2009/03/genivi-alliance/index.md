On Mar. 2, 2009 leading automobile manufacturers and suppliers announced
<br>
the formation of the <a href="" target="_blank">GENIVI Alliance</a> (pronounced gen-ee-vee), a non-profit organization committed to driving the development and broad adoption of an open source In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) reference platform.
<br>
<br>
GENIVI Alliance founding members BMW Group, Delphi, General Motors Corp., Intel,
<br>
Magneti Marelli, PSA Peugeot Citroën, Visteon Corp., and Wind River are collaborating to create a shared GENIVI platform - a common software architecture that is scalable across product lines and generations. The GENIVI platform will accelerate the pace at which automakers can deliver new solutions, bringing them closer to the lifecycle of consumer devices, and accelerating new business models, such as connected services.
<br>
<br>
Development of the open source GENIVI platform is well underway, with a summer
<br>
2009 launch for the first technical deliverable.
<br>
This deliverable will be based on a tested automotive prototype – running on the Intel® Atom™ processor and Wind River Linux - that was developed over the last 18 months by GENIVI members. The reference implementation will be made available as open source code to stimulate innovation among developers. 
<br>
<br>
You can find the <a href="http://www.genivi.org/RESOURCES/TechnicalDocuments/tabid/449/Default.aspx" target="_blank">technical documentation</a> here later.
<br>
<br>
If you take a look at the high level platform viel, published in the technical facts sheet:

<br>
<br>
You could imagine, that this bear analogy to something we know since a few months: <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/basics/what-is-android.html" target="_blank">The Andoid OS</a>.

<br>
<br>
Comparing high level architecture is of course not the only hint on any possibly similarities. Second evidence could be <a href="" target="_blank">Windriver's</a> membership in both organizations. They are on board with the Genivi project and also a member of the <a href="" target="_blank">Open Handset Alliance</a> that defined Android. 
<br>
I am very curious about the further information on Genivi.
