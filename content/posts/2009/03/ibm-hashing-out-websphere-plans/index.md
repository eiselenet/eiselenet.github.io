Paul Krill from <a href="" target="_blank">Infoworld </a>interviewed Savio Rodrigues, IBM product manager for WebSphere Application Server at the SD West 2009 conference in Santa Clara, Calif. <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/09/03/12/IBM_hashing_out_WebSphere_plans_1.html" target="_blank">about the future directions the WebSphere Application Server will go</a>.
<br>
<br>
IBM plans more componentizing of its WebSphere Java application server as well as additional dynamic language support. This will continue with extensions to the existing version 7 of WebSphere or with other upgrades. 
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 In future versions, we're going to extend our work with OSGi to further componentize the app server so that finer-grain components are started up
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 Support for dynamic languages helps with developing situational applications that need to be completed in days, said Rodrigues. "[For] that type of application, something like PHP or Groovy is much better for [that]," he said. 
 <br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
 Well, I think that over the last 10 years with Java technology, we've really taken Java to the core of server-side applications. Application servers now appear not only as the foundation for end-user custom applications, but also are the foundation for a whole series of other programming models," such as enterprise service buses
