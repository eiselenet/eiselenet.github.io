I attended a session by Adam Leftik and Jeff Trent at this years Oracle OpenWorld. It was all about the future of weblogic server and some upcomming features. As usual this has been presented under the standard disclaimer which states, that it is only an outline of the general product direction and no commitment to any features at all. Anyway, I strongly believe that this gives quite a good overview about what is happening to the next Weblogic Server major release.

 Oracle WebLogic DM is comming!

 WebLogic 10gR3 surfaced a preview of server profiles, and some of the underpinnings to support the profiles which were put in place. For example, the console is already capable of dealing with the profiles (i.e., the absence of a full EE server). So a WebLogic DM Server profile can coexist inside of a WebLogic domain, alongside an EE profile. Both profiles will share the same OSGi-based microkernel, the management capabilities, and lifecycle support. The common microkernel and the investment in modularity allow for examining other packaging options – for example, a messaging profile.
