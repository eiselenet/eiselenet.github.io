The conversion strategy is going to pay of for the customers. Today, <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/jrockit_is_now_free_and">Henrik announced</a>, that JRockit is free. Not as in free-beer but at last under the same conditions, you are used to have for the Sun HotSpot JVM. Oracle has been talking about this since months (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/henrik/entry/oracles_jvm_strategy">blog</a>) and we are all very excited to see the new converged JVM finally. This is a first big step towards a high reliable, performing and single JVM for all your Java needs. Henrik also published some FaQs along with this&nbsp;announcement: I picked the ones, I like the most:
<br>
<br>
 Q: <i>Does this mean I can now use JRockit with any Java application?</i>
<br>
 A: <b>Yes, under the same terms as you currently use the Oracle (Sun) JDK. You don't need to inform us and you don't need to pay anything.</b>
<br>
<br>
 Come-on: Give your heart a kick: Let's go: I've written a very short howto starting over with <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/01/running-glassfish-with-jrockit.html">JRockit and GlassFish</a>. Start using it today! :)
<br>
<br>
 Q: <i>I am a developer, does this mean I can now use JRockit Mission Control for free?</i>
<br>
 A: <b>Yes, there is no cost for development use. See the license for details.</b>
<br>
<br>
 Wow .. man, this is great news in general: <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2010/07/jrockit-mission-control-suite-and.html">I personally love the JRMC</a>. It's the most complete and ootb solution for getting your JVM under control. Nothing against VisualVM or even the JConsole, but ... JRMC plays in a league of it's own. 
<br>
<br>
 In general Oracle seems not to recommend moving to JRockit today. Even if you could. I guess, they are right. Everything in Henriks post seems to indicate, that they are willing to have the first converged version out with the Java SE 7 / OpenJDK 7 release later the year. 
<br>
 Anyway, if you are in need for some very effective memory management and a high speed JVM. You finally have it! Great!
<br>
<br>
 And don't forget to look at the JRockit bible: "Oracle JRockit - The Definitive Guide". I have <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2010/11/review-oracle-jrockit-definitive-guide.html">written a review about </a>it a few months ago and I am still getting goose skin thinking about the hard time this book gave me ... but it was worth it!
