A short update on the <a href="" target="_blank">DOAG 2011 Conference and Exhibition</a>. Beside all the posts lately I nearly completely forgot about the running <a href="http://mydoag.doag.org/termine/cfp.php?id=422990&amp;loc=en" target="_blank">CfP (Call for Presentations)</a>.

</div>In more than 400 speakers slots the DOAG 2011 Conference, which takes place November 15th-17th, 2011 in Nuremberg, provides current information on the successful use of the Oracle products as well as practical tips and tricks and exchange of experience. The varity of the presentations is addressing and covering all important fields of the Oracle products - ranging from database to middleware and business applications. This is the optimal opportunity to enlarge your network and to profit from the experiences and know-how of all users. For me the two most important parts are the Oracle Middleware and Development streams. The last one contains an important&nbsp;sub stream: Java. This is the part where I am doing some review work this year. I'm a proud member of the Program Committee. So, I'm excited to see your contributions to this years DOAG Conference and hope, we will meet there!
