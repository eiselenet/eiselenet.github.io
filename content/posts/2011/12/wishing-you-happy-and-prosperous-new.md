Even if I didn't intent to write another post, I came across a wonderful offering of my former mentor and inspiration <a href="" target="_blank">Friedhelm Fischer</a>. Back in the days he was the one responsible for growing my interest in programming and web technologies.&nbsp;Nowadays he is marketing responsible for a German company after&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;running a <a href="" target="_blank">web design company</a> for years. He also is into 3D modeling and DSLR filming. Check out <a href="" target="_blank">his website</a>, if you have a second left during the leaving 2011.
