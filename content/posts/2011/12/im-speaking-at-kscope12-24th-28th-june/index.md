<a href="" target="_blank">ODTUG Kscope12</a> is the place to be for the Oracle technical community in 2012. If you are a developer, architect, technical lead, or database administrator who works with Application Express, Business Intelligence, Oracle EPM; including Hyperion products, Essbase, Planning; Database Development or Fusion Middleware, Kscope12 is where you should be. It’s hard to find a conference that’s big enough to attract world renowned speakers and small enough to get the chance to share knowledge. Kscope12 is that conference. Find it on <a href="" target="_blank">http://lanyrd.com/2012/kscope12/</a>

</div><b>UPDATE: 20.02.2012</b>
<br>
 Oracle OTN notified us today that they are not going to sponsor Kscope12. The updated Oracle ACE Director Travel Support Policy lists Kscope as one of those conferences, which: 
<br>
<blockquote>
 "[...] are well-established conferences and communities, in FY13 we will not provide travel support [...]"
</blockquote> Unfortunately this means, that I will not have a sponsor for travel and&nbsp;accommodation&nbsp;and therefore I will have to withdraw my session proposals which I am going to do in a minute via email. So, I wish everybody a wonderful conference.

<br><b>Original post (for your reference):</b>
<br>
 After two wonderful Kscopes in 2010 and 2011 I have the pleasure to attend a third round. This time in San Antonio, Texas in the JW Marriott which combines the rustic beauty of the Texas countryside with the upscale elegance of the flagship property. Built in 2010, this property boasts a state-of-the-art meeting space and Internet access.

 I will be giving two sessions about Java EE and WebLogic server. And yes, I will use WebLogic 12c for everything I am going to show :)
