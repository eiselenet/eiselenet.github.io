Yesterday Oracle announced, what we all were expecting. JavaOne 2011 will be in the exact same place than the more or less&nbsp;disastrous 2010 version. It will be located in downtown San Francisco and takes place in parallel with Oracle OpenWorld. To be honest, this is not a big surprise. Did anybody expect them to move such an event within less than a year? Let's see, what's going to change and what to expect.

</table>Like last year it will be held in the hotels around the Mason Str. This have been the Hilton as the main conference Hotel with all the keynotes and&nbsp;demo grounds, the hotel Nikko and the Parc 55. Seeing <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/theaquarium/entry/javaone_2011_san_francisco_october">Alexis posting</a> about some changes:
<br>
<blockquote>
 [...] no more wandering between hotels and Moscone, more room for JavaOne sessions with Oracle Develop being moved to another venue [...]
</blockquote>It seems as if this will be a complete separate conference probably with completely separate social activities. So there should be no need to wander around. I don't know if this will improve the overall experience to me personally, because I used to visit OOW, OracleDevelop and JavaOne but until Oracle decides to shift J1 to another&nbsp;time frame this will be my personal problem. Until today I don't really see a reference to Oracle Develop. It seems as if it's completely vanished away. They will probably make it a more closer part of OpenWorld and leave all those poor Java guys alone ;) Let's see. 
<br>
 As Alexis also wrote:
<br>
<blockquote>
 [...] more community involvement in the event planning, more space and time for "hallway conversations", and more sessions overal. [...]
</blockquote>That sounds like fun. Hey, guys, if you are reading this: I am here to help! *wink* I would love to help!

<br><b>JavaOne Main Content Tracks</b>
<br>
 The content tracks cover the complete platform as expected. Sad to see, that the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/program-committee-077948.html">JavaOne program review committee</a> still is an old list. At last one external reviewer named there, <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joshbloch/status/62733926749306881" target="_blank">stated that he did not even got</a> an invitation up to now. Anyway, I hope they will try to tie in some community guys, too. The Java Champions of the ACE Directors for example? Why not :)
<br>
 And I am speculating that this years JavaOne will also have a huge drawback because the Google/Oracle case is still unsolved I don't expect any Googlers there ....sad.sad.sad.
