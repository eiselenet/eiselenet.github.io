Just a short notice. You can find a new article of mine in the latest Java Tech Journal (former JAXmag) issue. In <a href="http://blog.eisele.net/2011/03/new-article-for-latest-jaxmag-java-ee-6.html">last month's Java EE 6-centric issue of Java Tech Journal</a>, we looked at in-container testing for Java EE, with the Arquillian test framework; building RESTful Web Services in Java using JAX-RS; and were introduced to Java EE 6 compatible web profile servers, such as Siwpas. But, Java EE 6 marked a big step forward for the platform and there's still plenty of new technologies to cover in this second JTJ issue dedicated to all things Java EE 6!

 The big news in the Java EE 6 ecosystem is, of course, the release of GlassFish 3.1, which is both the first major update to the platform since the debut of the 3.0 series and the first major release of GlassFish under Oracle. How does GlassFish 3.1 compare to the community roadmap presented by Oracle in March, 2010? Check out our 'GlassFish 3.1: What's New and Hot' article to find out!
