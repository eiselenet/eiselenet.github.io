Another short hint about a recently published article of mine. The German iJUG Magazin called "<a href="http://www.ijug.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10" target="_blank">Java Aktuell</a>" is available since 1st of September and you can read all about the new Java 7 release. If you like, you can check out some other articles of mine. Some of them done in English, too, you just search this blog for posts, labeled "<a href="http://blog.eisele.net/search/label/article">article</a>" and you get some results.

 The green light was on 28.07. The long wait for the new Java came to an end. After more than four and a half years, the Java community is celebrating the beginning of a comeback to modernize the language.
