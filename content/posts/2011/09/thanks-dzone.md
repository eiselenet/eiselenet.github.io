You know, I don't often get gifts. And if I get some, I'm feeling sad about receiving them (Exception: Books and T-Shirts ;)). This weekend a special envelope was squeezed into my mailbox. Send from the <a href="">DZone</a> Team.

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
 <a href="IMG-20110903-00020.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="IMG-20110903-00020.jpg" width="150"></a>
</div> "In Appreciation for your Contribution to DZone". Wow. Thanks. Those guys know how to make me happy. Beside a nice, blue T-Shirt I got some of their latest <a href="">RefCardz</a>&nbsp;and two magnetic stickers. The stickers were acquired by my little ones shortly but the T-Shirt is mine. At last after the little photo-shooting we did for this blog post. I'm a <a href="http://java.dzone.com/users/myfear">DZone MVB</a> since the beginning of the year and contribute to "The heart of the Java developer community", the <a href="">Javalobby@DZone</a>. Thanks Dzone for providing a great source of inspiration and information. It's an honor to be part of the MVB program and I am looking forward to the next years.
