Just a short notice: I am honored to be a member of the <a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/p/jcg.html" target="_blank">JCG Program</a> as of today. The JCG program builds mutually beneficial partnerships between Java Code Geeks and community bloggers whose articles are of interest to the Java developer community.

</div> The program simplifies the process of publishing selected blog articles by JCG members onto <a href="" target="_blank">Java Code Geeks</a> site. Through this process, our JCGs enjoy substantially increased visibility and our audience enjoys great content. I am looking forward to my first post there and I am really happy to present awesome content to all the JCG readers!
