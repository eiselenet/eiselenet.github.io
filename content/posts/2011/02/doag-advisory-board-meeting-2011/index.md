</div>Roughly 60 <a href="">participants</a> are expected. I guess I'll post some impressions from the weekend, as I get the chance to. I am very looking forward meeting all those great guys again and work with them towards the future of the German Oracle Users Group (<a href="http://www.doag.org/?content=_engl" target="_blank">DOAG e.V.</a>)
