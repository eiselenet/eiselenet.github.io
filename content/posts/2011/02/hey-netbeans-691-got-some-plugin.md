It was like: WOW today ... Starting my IDE this morning was a big surprise. Being used to Eclipse since some time, the regular update check was something I really missed with NetBeans. But it is simply useless. First of all there are not that many plugins around and second they don't update that often. What a big surprise, seeing the IDE telling me, there actually IS something to update. Here we go:
<br>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
 <a href="plugin_updates.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="plugin_updates.png" width="317"></a>
</div>
<br>
 Most of them are minor changes. And I was not able to get a list of changes in any of them. But: Hey, thanks for the Update, NetBeans Team :) Looking forward to the 7.0 final!
