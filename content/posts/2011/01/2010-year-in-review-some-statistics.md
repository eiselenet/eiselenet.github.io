 As expected, the hottest time in the year was during JavaONE and Open World. People came here mostly send from google, dzone and java.net or visited this blog directly. I have had a small number of 114 posts last year.
<br>
<br>
 Personaly I flew a total distance of roughly 1,23 earth circulations. With the shortest flight being 300km and the longest 9.500km. This was a total of 81,8 hours inflight entertainment on ten different plane types for me. In total I produced 6,705 kg CO2 in 2010. Thats more than douple of this, I did in 2009 :( Sorry for that ....
<br>
<br>
 I posted 626 pictures to <a href="http://flickr.com/myfear" target="_blank">flickr</a>. Most of them taken during the three big conferences I visited in 2010 (Kaleidoscope, OpenWorld/JavaONE, DOAG Conference).
<br>
<br>
 I tweet <a href="http://tweetstats.com/graphs/myfear" target="_blank">a little</a>. On average 14,6 tweets per day with roughly 50% of them being retweets of others. My top five words: rt, java, oracle, new, glassfish. My top five hashtags: #java, #glassfish, #javaone, #oracle, #aced.
<br>
<br>
 All in all this was an exciting year. I loved to be part of a vital blogger scene around Java, Oracle, GlassFish and WebLogic. And I hope that I will be able to continue in 2011. Thanks again for visiting!
