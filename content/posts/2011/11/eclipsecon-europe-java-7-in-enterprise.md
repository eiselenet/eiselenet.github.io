Yesterday at EclipseCon Europe 2011, I gave two talks about Java 7 use in the enterprise. Both had their attendees (around 40 to 50) and I think the input I gave was quite valuable to them. The motivation of both talks was to actually show, how and where to apply the <a href="" target="_blank">55 new things in Java 7</a> and try to write down what you need to keep in mind doing migration projects. This was also thought of as a decision helper for choosing the right Java SE version to start with these days. Thanks again for anybody attending! It was a pleasure to be there. My first time at EclipseCon Europe and I liked what I have seen. Thanks to Donald and Dalibor for jumping in on questions regarding "official dates" :)

 Both presentations are uploaded to slideshare. I heard that there will be an audio recording available some time soon, I'll keep you updated!
