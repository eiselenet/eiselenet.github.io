Have you seen the otn post from end of July? <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/otn/entry/are_you_kidding_me_163" target="_blank">163 Oracle ACE Sessions at Oracle OpenWorld 2011</a>. 
<br>
 That's a huge number. Compared to the <a href="http://apex.oracle.com/pls/otn/f?p=19297:3:1434089860594050" target="_blank">358 ACEs and ACE Directors</a> out there, this makes a 
<br>
 total of 45% of the overall ACEs speaking at "their" number one conference. 
<br>

 <a href="http://apex.oracle.com/pls/otn/wwv_flow_file_mgr.get_file?p_security_group_id=2555808315878754841&amp;p_fname=aces_logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://apex.oracle.com/pls/otn/wwv_flow_file_mgr.get_file?p_security_group_id=2555808315878754841&amp;p_fname=aces_logo.png"></a>
</div> But what the OpenWorld is to the ACEs that should JavaOne be for the Java Champions, right? Consider this another conference analysis, like I did a few times before. 
<br>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
 <a href="Java_Champions_clr.gif" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="Java_Champions_clr.gif"></a>
</div> The Java Champions are an exclusive group of passionate Java technology and community <a href="http://java-champions.java.net/bios.html" target="_blank">leaders </a>who are community-nominated and selected under a project sponsored by Oracle. Java Champions get the opportunity to provide feedback, ideas, and direction that will help Oracle grow the Java Platform. This interchange may be in the form of technical discussions and/or community-building activities with Oracle's Java Development and Developer Program teams. According to their <a href="http://java.net/website/java-champions/bios.html" target="_blank">bio page</a>, there are 126 active JCs.
<br>
<br>
 If you take this information and match it against the <a href="https://oracleus.wingateweb.com/scheduler/speakers.do" target="_blank">speaker page</a> of the most recently published JavaOne 2011 content catalog you get the amazing number of: 15%. That's the percentage of actively talking JCs at JavaOne this year. Compared with the Oracle ACEs this is .. let's call it: A little less. 
<br>
<br>
 Of course there are many reasons for that. Fist is that Google is obviously still boycotting JavaOne. Another might be, that there are many researchers listed which simply doesn't fit into the content catalog. Any other ideas? Let me know!
