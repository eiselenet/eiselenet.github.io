And it is rapidly approaching. 106,560 minutes or 1776 hours or rounded 10 weeks until the industry meets again in San Francisco! If you were waiting for the <a href="https://oracleus.wingateweb.com/scheduler/eventcatalog/eventCatalogJavaOne.do?Src=7308729&amp;Act=36&amp;pcode=WWMK11042185MPP016" target="_blank">content catalog</a>, it is finally there, too. With over 400 Sessions in 8 tracks this will be a huge event. As you know, I was helping to shape the Java EE Web Profile and Platfrom Technologies - Track. It has 71 sessions, 3 panels, 3 hands-on-labs and 38 Birds-of-a-Feather sessions and here are my personal highlights:
<br>
<br><b>Conference Sessions</b>

</div> This years topics clearly are Java EE 6 and 7. Beside introducing the new specification with it's latest developments you can get involved with all the latest Java EE 6 best practices from the most well know experts. Let's start with the new products to look at:
<br>
<br><i>Application servers</i>
<br>
 Beside the fact, that the industry still lags some Java EE 6 support with the commercial vendors, some OSS alternatives have grown up. Most notably the latest AS7 by JBoss and the Apache TomEE Web Profile container. 
<br>
 - David Blevins from the Apache Software Foundation introduces you to Apache TomEE Java EE 6 Web Profile (<i>23680</i>)
<br>
 - Andrew Rubinger from the JBoss by Red Hat, get's you started with Death of the Slow: JBoss AS7 (<i>25288</i>).
<br>
<br><i>Java EE 7</i>
<br>
 There is plenty of room for the upcoming Java EE specification this year. Beside the minor updates to existing specifications we also have some new stuff in stock for you. 
<br>
 - Manik Surtani, Red Hat Inc. A Tale About Caching (JSR 107) and Data Grids (JSR 347) in Enterprise Java (<i>23382</i>)
<br>

<br>
<br><i>GlassFish</i>
<br>
 Being the reference implementation for Java EE it's not a big surprise to see some more details about GlassFish. It's not half as much as I would have liked to see but that's probably ok for the majority :)
<br>
 - Ludovic Champenois, Oracle gives you the latest insights for the GlassFish REST Administration Back End: An Insider Look at a Real REST Application (<i>25008</i>)
<br>

<br>
<br><i>Arquillian</i>
<br>
 I'm proud to see Dan and Aslak presenting on their baby. Arquillian is behind this one and you should reserve the date!
<br>
 Dan Allen and Aslak Knutsen both Red Hat Real Java Enterprise Testing (<i>23813</i>)
<br>
 If you have some input for both, you can also reserve the time for the corresponding BoF (Arquillian: The Extendable Enterprise Test Platform, <i>24121</i>)
<br>
<br><b>BoF sessions</b>
<br>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
 <a href="IMG_3358.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="IMG_3358.jpg" width="320"></a>
</div> Some proposals didn't make it as a conference session (for many reasons, I can tell you :)). But that's not sad because we still have the BoFs for a more open discussion. And there are quite a lot this year. Here is a very short list of my favs: 
<br>
<br>
 Beginning with the GlassFish Community Event (<i>23426</i>), which is hosted by Anil Gaur and Alexis Moussine-Pouckine (both Oracle of course). You should (!) sign up in advance for this one <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=151433824934940" target="_blank">via facebook</a> (more details on <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/arungupta/entry/glassfish_community_event_and_party1" target="_blank">aruns blog</a>.)
<br>
<br>

 And you need to see Lincoln Baxter III (Red Hat) talking about <a href="" target="_blank">PrettyFaces </a>Beautiful Java EE: URL Rewriting for the Next-Generation Web User (<i>24507</i>)
<br>
<br>
 And we also have some chance for the community to give their valuable input for the next Java EE specification. Don't let this chance pass: 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br><b>Hands-On Labs</b>
<br>

</div> Only three this year. I mean: this is only for the Java EE part. So don't be afraid. There is a lot of stuff to discover. JavaOne has 13 hands-on-labs overall. If you are beginning with Java EE, you should attend the following two. Sign up early, as there is not infinite space available in the rooms:
<br>
<br>
 Alexis Moussine-Pouckine from Oracle gives you a kick start with Beginning Java EE 6 (<i>23421</i>). A two hour introductory session about everything you need to know to get started. 
<br>
<br>
 The second by Byron Nevins and Arun Gupta, both Oracle introduce you to Develop, Deploy, and Monitor a Java EE 6 Application with Clustered GlassFish 3.1 (<i>19120</i>)
