Wow. What a day. The Java 7 launch event generated a lot of buzz around Java again. Finally. Java is breathing again and we all enjoyed it, right? But the main Java event is still going to happen. And it's web-pages have been updated, too :) This will be this years <a href="" target="_blank">JavaOne</a>. After weeks of preparations and hard work, the content teams finished their first rounds. Even if I can not tell you any details about the Technical Sessions, Birds of Feather, Panels or Hands-on labs at the moment. There is one thing I can tell you: It will be awesome! Packed with all the latest information, trends and best practices from the best know speakers around.

 You ask, why I know this? This is pretty simple. I'm proud to be a member of the external reviewers team for the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/quick-links/program-committee/index.html#javaee" target="_blank">Java EE Web Profile and Platform Technologies</a> Track.

 Don't miss the chance to checkout the (high level) <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/program/schedule/index.html">schedule</a> which already gives a good overview of the things to come from Sunday to Thursday! And <a href="http://www.oracle.com/javaone/activities/zone/index.html">The Zone</a> pages also have been updated. I am really looking forward to it. Even if I am slightly disappointed to see it happening all over Hilton San Francisco, Hotel Nikko, and Parc 55 Wyndham again. Good news is, that there'll probably be more separation in general from the OOW/Oracle Develop parts. Let's see.
