The second part of my German article series on <a href="http://heise.de/developer">heise.de/developer</a> went online today. A little bit late as I hoped it to see yesterday already, but I know the reasons and if you are reading this: Keeping my fingers cross for you!

<br>
 The second part is about fork/join and NIO.2. So, you get a very comprehensive introduction into the new features in this two areas including some code examples and explanations. I'm looking forward to your comments and hope you enjoy it. Read it; for free, German and online <a href="http://heise.de/-1288272/ftw">http://heise.de/-1288272/ftw</a>
