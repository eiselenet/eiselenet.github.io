</div> Wow. I haven't blogged here in a while. Good news, the blog isn't dead and not going to die anytime soon. I'm just spending a lot of time blogging over at <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/blog" target="_blank">lightbend.com/blog</a> (Have you seen the monthly <a href="https://www.lightbend.com/blog?query=Tech+Digest" target="_blank">Lightbend Tech Digest</a> yet?) and also help developing additional content around our open source projects. Mostly Lagom. And I am very happy to announce that my first Refcard was published on DZone today: And it is about Lagom, obviously!

<br><i>The Reactive Microservices Framework</i>
<br>
<br>
 This Refcard helps you with your first steps in Lagom. Lagom is a framework that helps you to build reactive microservices.
<br>
<br>
 Most microservices frameworks focus on helping you build fragile, single instance microservices - which, by definition, aren’t scalable or resilient. Lagom helps you build microservices as systems — Reactive systems, to be precise — so that your microservices are elastic and resilient from the start and don’t require extra plumbing around them.
<br>
<br>
 Building Reactive Systems can be hard, but Lagom abstracts the complexities away. Akka and Play do the heavy lifting underneath and developers can focus on a simpler event-driven programming model on top while benefitting from a message-driven system under the hood. Lagom provides an opinionated framework that acts like guide rails to speed you along the journey. Lagom tools and APIs simplify development and deployment of a system that includes microservices.
