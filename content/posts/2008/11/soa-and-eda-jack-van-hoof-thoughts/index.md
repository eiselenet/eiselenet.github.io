I was looking around the web to catch up with my favorite pages these days and came across an interesting blog. You might already know Jack van Hoof. 
<br>
<br>
 Jack’s interests lie in IT technology trends and innovation; combined with three decades of extensive practical experience makes Jack a credible IT visionary. He maintains a blog where he publishes his thoughts on SOA and EDA:

 See a more complete vita at the <a href="http://www.soamag.com/contributors/bio-jhoof.asp" target="_blank">contributors page</a> of the soa-magazine.
<br>
<br>
 Ok. It is not a big secret that SOA is something "special" to me. What means I have my own personal oppinion about the three letters and their meaning to projects.
<br>
 But the thoughts on Jack's blog are worth more than one minute of reading.
<br>
<br>
 I personaly like his posts about "<a href="http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/2007/06/magical-of-soa-and-eda.html" target="_blank">The magical A of SOA and EDA</a>" and also his very abstract view on the <a href="http://soa-eda.blogspot.com/2008/03/what-is-purpose-of-enterprise.html" target="_blank">role of enterprise architecture in a company</a>. 
<br>
<br>
 If you have time. Give his blog a try!
