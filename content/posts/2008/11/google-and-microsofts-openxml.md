Google started to support Microsoft's Office Open XML formats in Gmail and web search. You can now view as HTML documents created using Microsoft Office 2007: .docx documents, .xslx spreadsheets and .pptx presentations.

Google Docs doesn't yet support importing Open XML files. But I expect this to happen shortly, too :)
