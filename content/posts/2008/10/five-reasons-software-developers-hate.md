Today I found a great posting on the <a href="" target="_blank">architect zone</a>. <a href="http://architects.dzone.com/articles/five-reasons-software-develope" target="_blank">Pete Johnson writes</a> about his promotion to a "HP.com Chief Architect" and gave it a more deper thought. He came up with five things, a software architect can make wrong.
<br>
<br>
<ol>
 <br>
 <li>The cockiness <br></li>
 <li>Losing touch with technology <br></li>
 <li>Keeping clean hands by delegating all the dirty work <br></li>
 <li>Taking credit for everything, even when you did nothing <br></li>
 <li>Finding opportunities for yourself, but not for others <br></li>
</ol>

 When the responsibility escalates to little or no coding and being in charge of the long term direction of multiple projects simultaneously, when that person spends more time in meetings than anything else and gets this "architect" title, the bridges start to get burned and the hate begins to flow. Before long, that guy you used to enjoy going on lunchtime burrito runs with asserts himself in ways you never thought possible and seems to be leading your project team, as well as the others he's been given jurisdiction, over an irrational cliff.

In my personal oppionion he perfectly nailed the points down. The bigger the projects get, the more you are in trouble and the easier it is to forget about the mentioned things. The only thing you can do is to find your personal way through all the different needs of your team members, customers, technology or whatever else hits your road doing a successfull project.
