Firefox 3.1 Beta 1 is out and with it comes a huge pile of new features for developers. While those of you who follow <a href="" target="_blank">Mozilla’s web-tech blog </a>might know about some of them. Together with the release of the first beta of 3.1 a short summary of the bigger features can be found in the <a href="" target="_blank">related posting</a>.

<ul>
 <br>
 <li>Geolocation</li>
 <br>
 <li>@font-face</li>
 <br>
 <li>Video and Audio support</li>
 <br>
 <li>XHR enhancements</li>
 <br>
 <li>TraceMonkey</li>
 <br>
</ul>
<br>

There are several other features that are scheduled for Firefox 3.1 Beta 2 and are partially implemented in the beta 1 already. Mozilla will talk about more once Beta 2 is available. Some of the things you can expect are Worker Threads for JavaScript, new graphics, SVG and CSS capabilities and probably other things as well. <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Firefox_3.1_for_developers" target="_blank">The Firefox 3.1 for Developers page</a> is the full source for new stuff that’s coming for 3.1.
