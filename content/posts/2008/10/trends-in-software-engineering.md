Yesterday was a highlight to me. We had the chance to hear <a href="" target="_blank">Michael Stal</a> about trends in software engineering. You can find a <a href="http://stal.blogspot.com/2008/10/trends-in-software-architecture.html" target="_blank">brief posting </a>about his session on <a href="http://stal.blogspot.com" target="_blank">his blog</a>.
<br>
<br>
 Beside the (not always suprising) contents of the session I really liked the quotes he inserted :)
<br>
<br>
 Failure and understanding failure is a
<br>
 key factor for successful design!
<br>
 [Henry Petroski]
<br>
<br>
 Ad-hoc re-use is the root of all evil
<br>
 [Jan Bosch]
<br>
<br>
 There is nothing permanent except
<br>
 change.
