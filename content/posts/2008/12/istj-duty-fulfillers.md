 Found a nice site today. <a href="" target="_blank">http://www.typealyzer.com/</a>. They analyze your blog and tell you who you are. According to them, I am:
<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
 <br>
  The responsible and hardworking type. They are especially attuned to the details of life and are careful about getting the facts right. Conservative by nature they are often reluctant to take any risks whatsoever.
 <br>
 <br>
  The Duty Fulfillers are happy to be let alone and to be able to work int heir own pace. They know what they have to do and how to do it. 
 <br>

 It's quite obvious, that I do not realy fit into this classification ;) At least for those, realy knowing me. But anyway. I like it to see, that I am able to express my thoughts clearly enough for the rest of the world in this blog :)
