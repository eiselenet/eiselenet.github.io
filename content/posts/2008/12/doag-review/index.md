I am back from this year's <a href="" target="_blank">DOAG Conference</a>. It was my first time beeing there and I can tell you it was a pleasure to take part. Beside my mini lesson yesterday, which was about introducing the Weblogic server to the oracle community, I meet some friends that I have not seen for a longer time.
<br>
All was very well organized and one of the hightlights for me was the concentration of other european ACE Directors around. I mostly enjoyed the keynotes. Quite a surprise to see the Oracle top management engaged with the DOAG.
<br>
<br>
The sessions were focused on all kinds of Oralce technolgies. Of course the datatbase and themes around took the biggest space. I was a bit disappointed about the few bea/weblogic sessions. Around 4 were canceled during the conference, too. I would love to see a bigger emphasis on this the next time.

Anyway: I will try to join again next year!
