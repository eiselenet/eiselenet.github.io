Oracle released a set of Eclipse plug-ins designed to help develop, deploy and debug applications for Oracle WebLogic Server. It installs as a plug-in to your existing Eclipse, or will install Eclipse for you, and supports your favorite server or servlet engine. It is designed to support Java EE development.
<br>
<br>
It has full support for WebLogic Server versions 10.3, 10.0, and 9.2 (with limited support for 9.1, 9.0, and 8.1) and contains the Oracle Database Plugin for Eclipse DTP, too. Beside this, you can find a JSF Facelets technology preview. Using Facelets, you develop JSF pages using XHTML instead of JSP.
