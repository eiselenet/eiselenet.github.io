There was some time this morning and I found this perfectly spended on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity" target="_blank">Ubiquity</a>. The recently launched alpha of an awesome new firefox plugin. Have a deeper look at it by reading the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_User_Tutorial" target="_blank">User Tutorial</a>.
<br>
I just played a bit around with the first steps presented in the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Ubiquity/Ubiquity_0.1_Author_Tutorial" target="_blank">Author Tutorial</a> and compiled a quick Xing-Search Command.
<br>
<br>
You can grep the <a href="http://www.eisele.net/ubiscripts/xing-search.js" target="_blank">.js from my server</a> and type CTRL-SHIFT "command-editor" and paste the small sniplet into the <a href="chrome://ubiquity/content/editor.html" target="_blank">Command Editor</a>
