I uploaded two new <a href="http://www.eisele.net/berufliches_artikel_online.html">online articles</a> to eisele.net today. To be honest. They are quite old. One in terms of time, the other in terms of the topic. 
<br><a href="http://www.eisele.net/berufliches_artikel_online.html">The first one is about maven.</a> I had to use it in one of my projects recently. This was quite new for me, because up to now we mostly used ant and water ;) and nothing else.
<br><a href="http://www.eisele.net/berufliches_artikel_online_microsoft_office_mal_anders.html">The second one is about Microsoft Office 2003 </a>and it's XML capabilites to interact with a user as an application frontend. 
<br>
Both unfortunately in german only.
