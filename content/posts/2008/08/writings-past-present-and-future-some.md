I finished a new article yesterday. This will be about the new <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/ias/bea_main.html" target="_blank">Oracle Weblogic Server 10gR3</a>. Beside this, there was not too much time this year for articles and new stuff. Mainly because I have to work on a big project that does not realy allow spending time for private things.
<br>
Anyhow, I search for new topics and hypes wherever possible. And of course I look back in time. This was my starting point today to browse my published articles archive. Not too much. But impressive for me at all. <a href="http://www.eisele.net/berufliches.html">37 published articles </a>in seven different magazines. Two of them only publish online versions. All started back in 2003. With an article about Flash MX and webapplications. Together with a former coworker <a href="" target="_blank">Kai Koenig</a>. This lean start was followed by another article in 2004. The first one about BEA stuff. Driven by a project at work, I was able to compile some details about Weblogic Portal Server. <a href="http://www.eisele.net/berufliches_artikel05.html">I wrote five articles in 2005</a>. Among them you can find the first published version of a review about the Weblogic Server. <a href="http://www.eisele.net/berufliches_artikel06.html">The year 2006</a> was my best article year up to now. 17 more or less in a row. This means I was present more than once a month in the german IT magazin world :-) Big deal, if you ask me ;) The curve went down after this. <a href="http://www.eisele.net/berufliches_artikel07.html">In 2007 </a>I was only able to write nine articles at all. For now it seems as if I can not hold the frequent writings up like this. <a href="http://www.eisele.net/berufliches_artikel08.html">In 2008</a> I finished only four. Maybe two or three will follow. But it seems as if the 2007 specification can not be met at all.

Anyhow, I will try to stick to writings. It's quite relaxing to me to structure thoughts and share them with a broader audience. Maybe I get the chance to do more writings in english next year :) Or a book. A book is something on the list of things to do for me since a very long time :)
