After the content migration from former dev2dev to the OTN, I still need some time to get used to the new layout, the new content arrangements and last but not least the brand :) But anyway: The quality of the content on OTN is great.

If you want to get an impression of the new Oracle Workshop (shipped with new Weblogic 10g R3) and it's JEE5 support, read this great article by Andrei Cioroianu.
