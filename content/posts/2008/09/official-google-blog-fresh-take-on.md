Google did it again! <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html" target="_blank">Today they anounced their own browser version.</a> Up to now, only a bunch of <a href="" target="_blank">screenshots are available</a>. During the day (21:00, german time) a first beta should be available for download for Windows systems. <a href="http://google.com/chrome" target="_blank">If available, you can find the download here</a>.
