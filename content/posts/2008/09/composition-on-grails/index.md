SAP released a new technology feature and integrated Grails into their platform.
<br>
The Composition on Grails project uses the Groovy scripting language and the Grails "Rails-like" web application framework (called <a href="https://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/wiki?path=/display/Community/Composition%2bOn%2bGrails" target="_blank" title="CoGConsole">CoGConsole</a>) , plus some SAP- specific extensions for Web Dynpro, Enterprise Web Services, and BAPIs, to allow quick and easy development of composite applications on SAP NetWeaver 7.1 CE.
<br>
<br>
<p>The guiding principles behind the Composition on Rails project are:</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>Less software</b><br>
  Keep it short and simple. Minimizing the code for a composite application likewise minimizes the development and maintenance effort.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><b>Convention over configuration</b><br>
  Skip the XML files. Use naming conventions for automatic data binding. The framework knows how to do what you want most of the time. You only have to make changes if you want something that isn't predictable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 <li><b>Reduce abstraction impedance</b><br>
  By using scripting as a consistent programming model for the entire composite, you avoid overhead from transforming data and functions between different programming abstractions.</li>
</ul>
