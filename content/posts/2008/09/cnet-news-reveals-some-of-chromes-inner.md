Read a <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-10032636-92.html?tag=newsLeadStoriesArea.0" target="_blank">CNET news articel</a> about the inner workings of chrome today.

Beside some more internal stats and features, it also reveals an Easter egg :)
<br>
<br>
Here are some of the magic: about: * functions:
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold;">about:memory</span> shows how much memory the browser--and any other Web browser--is using. Conveniently for Web developers, it also shows how much each Web site in a browser tab is using.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold;">about:stats</span> shows a wide range of internal measurements such as the time taken to initialize Chrome, load Gears, or perform various operations while running JavaScript programs with Chrome's V8 engine. The page also carries the amusing note, "Shhh! This page is secret!"
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold;">about:network</span> tracks the detailed network activity of using a Web site.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold;">about:histograms</span> graphs various performance measurements such as the time taken to autocomplete text users type into the browser.
<br>
<br><span style="font-weight:bold;">about:crash</span> crashes the active browser tab.
